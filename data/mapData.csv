THIS EVENING WE HAVE EXAMPLES OF TRADITIONAL MUSIC FROM ETHIOPIA, ONE OF THE OLDFST STATES ON THE CONTINENT OF AFRICA AND A COUNTRY WITH MORE THAN l 2000 YEARS OF RECORDED HISTORY. ANCImT ETHIOIPIAN HISTORICAL RECORDS SHOW THAT PEOPLE HAD ALREADY SETTLED IN THE COUNTRY DURING THE SECOND MILLENIUM B.C., THAT Is, 2000 YEARS BEFORE CHRIST. LATER, SOMETIME DURING THE PERIOD OF 1000 YEARS B.C., A RAGE OF PEOPLE FROM SOUTHEAST ARABIA HAD SETLLED IN THE NORTHERN REGION OF PRESENT DAY ETHIOPIA. WAGE OF THOSE EARLY SETTLERS WAS GE'EZ(g'h - 'z) WHICH IS STILL THE LANGUAGE USED IN THE ETHIOPIAN CHURCH. DURING THE FIRST CENTURY A.D., THERE WAS A POWERFUL KINGDOM KNOWN AS THE AXIMITE EMPIRE. REMAINS FROM THAT PERIOD, SUCH As COINS AND METALS, AND RUINS OF PALACES AND TEAPLES, SHOW THAT GREAT TECHNICAL SKILL AND ADVANCEMENT EXISTED AT THAT TIME. IT IS ALSO IMPORTANT T0 MENTION HERE THAT ON THE AFRICAN CONTIEENT, ETHIOPIA ALONE, WITH THE EXCEPTION ' OF THE ARABIAN COUNTRIES, HAD A SCRIPT AND URITING SISTEM OF ITS OWN. DURING THE 17TH CENTURY THE COUNTRY EXPERIENCED A REVITALIZATION OF TRADITIONAL INSTITUTIOT RELIGIOUS, ARTISTIC AND CULTURAL, AND ESPECIALLY IN M USIC. THERE IS AN UNUSUALLY RICH VARIETY OF TYPES OF mSIC AND M USICAL INSTRUMENTS BECAUSE OF THE GREAT DIVERSITY 0F ETHNIC GROUPS. FIRST RECORDING IS FRCM THE 80mm PARTOFTHECOUNTRYAND IT FEATURES MJSIC OROMO V

( K/ MUSIC TIME IN AFRICA AUG.3o, 1987 87-35 PAGE TWO PEOPLE. THE SINGER IN THE RECORDING IS m a-Ã¯Â¬Â‚-ta SEN-ma, A WELL-KNOWN MUSICIAN FROM ARSI PROVINCE, AND FAMOUS FOR PERFORMING A LOCAL TYPE OF MUSIC CALLED OROMINYA. THE MUSICAL INSTRUMENTS IN THE RECORDING ARE mm A WASHINT FLUTE AND DRUM CALLED KABERO: MUSIC: CUT TWO: 2:15 COME IN FULL / music fades at end of cut VOICE: AMONG THE MHHY DIFFERENT TYPES OF MUSICAL INSTRUMENTS IN ETHIOPIA, THE BEST KNOWN IS THE KRAR, SPELLED K-R-A-R. THE WORD MEANS m, ""STRINGED"". harp soundbox PIECE OF In GOAT OR SHEEPSKIN. TRADITIDNALLY THE KRAR HAD GUT STRINGS,... THAT IS, THE STRINGS WERE MADE FROM THE TISSUES OF ANIMAL INTFSTIIJFS. WELL, NOWADAYS, THE STRINGS ARE EITHER MADE FROM SILK, WIRE AND MOST OFTEN NYLON. THE INSTRUMENT USUALLY HAS EIGHT OR TWELVE STRINGS THAT ARE PLU WITH THE FINGERS: Ã¢Â€Â˜ MUSIC: CUT THREE: 0:25 SECS COME IN FULL/ fades at end iofÃ¢Â€Â˜ cut HOICE: ACCORDING TO LEO, THERE ARE TWO WAYS OF PLAYING THE KRAR. THEIE Is THE OLD TRADITIONAL WAY OF MUTING TH E STRINGS. THAT IS, THE PLAYER SORT OF MUFFLE THEÃ‚Â§OUND OF THE STRINGS BY RESTING HIS LEFT HAND ON THE STRINGS. THE PREFERgnD WAY NOWADAYS IS I TO SIMPLY PLUCK THE OPEN STRINGS, GIVING THE MUSICIAN A BETTER OPPORTUNITY To CREATE HIGHLY ORNAMENTAL SOUND PATTERNS. THIS RECORDING IS A GOOD DEMONSTRATION OF PLUCKING THE OPEN STRINGS. THE KRAR IS PLAYED BY A (sneak MSTEHSHBSICIAN, KETEMA MAKONNEN, ANDthaSIC IS ""TIZITA,"" ONE OF ETHIOPIA'S MOST FAMOUS AND WELL-LOVED SONGS: MUSIC: CUT FOUR: 2:30 music fades at end of out y THE OTHER IMPORTANT STRINGED INSTRUMENT IN ETHIOPIA IS THE ""MASENKO,"" A TYPE OF FIDDLE PLAYED WITH A BOW. THE ORIGIN OF THIS INSTRUMENT IS UNTCTOWN BECAUSE IT IS COWON IN SO MANY OTHER COUNTRIES AROUND THE HORN OF AFRICA, IN N ORTH AFRICA, IN THE M IDDLE EAST AND ASIA THE SOUNDBOX OF THE MASENKO IS OF WOOD AND FORMED IN THE SHAPE OF A DIAMOND. Box IS COVERED lI-l WITH ANIMAL SKIN. THE 'MASENKoHAS ONLY ONE STRING AND THE PLAYER TRIES TO mITATE THE TONAL SPEECH PATTERNS OF THE HUMAN VOICE. AGAIN, I HAVE A VERY GOOD EXAMPLE OF MASENKO MUSIC THAT ALSO SHOWS A GREAT DEAL OF FANCY PLAYING: WSIC: CUT FIVE: 2:10 COTE IN BULL / msic fades at end of cut VOICE: AMONG ALL THE W TRADITIONAL WIND INSTTRUMENTS IN ETHIOPIA, THE ""WASHINT' Is DEFINITELY THE MOST IMPORTANT AND POPULAR TYPE OF FLUTE. IT'S A SIMPLE BAMBOO FLUTE THAT USUALLY HAS ONLY FOUR lull FINGER HOLES. I'lÃ¢Â€Â˜ PLAYS AN IMPORTANT PART IN AN ETHIOPIAN ORCHESTRA BECAUSE ALL THE STRINGED INSTRUMENTS ARE TUNED TO THE WASHINT. IN ETHIOPIA, THE INSTRUMENT IS CLOSELY ASSOCIAÃ¢Â€Â™IÃ¢Â€Â˜IED WITH SHEPHERDS AND IN RECENT TIMES, THE ZBENYA, THE WATCHMEN WHO KEEP AWAKE DURING THE LONG N IGHTS BY PLAYING THE WASHINT: mSIC: CUT SIX: 1:15 COME IN FULL/ maid fades at end of out A.)

MUSIC TIME IN AFRICA MUSIC: VOIEE: MUSIC : MAY 10, 1987 Ã¢Â€Â™ 87-Ã¢Â€Â˜19 PAGE TWO LIMPOPO RIVER TO INYANGA WAS KNOWN AS THE GAZA EMPIRE, ESTABLISHED BY THE FAMOUS WARRIOR CHIEF SHOSHANGANE. I BELIVE THAT WAS AROUND THE YEAR 18140, WHEN THERE WAS A LOT OF MOVEMENT GOING ON BY DIFFERENT GROUPS OF PEOPLE LIKE THE SHONA, NGUNI, MANISA, NDAU AND CHOPI. (...I assume that the nan: NDAU in Zimbabwe are the same as the SHAANGAAN in Mozambique, is that correct? . . . . . ..) o o o . n a n o u o o a n o a n o a g c o u o. WE CQE TO THE TRADITIONAL MUSIC AND DANCES IN TIE GAZA REGION, WE SEE THAT THERE WAS A GREAT INFLUENCE OF NGUNI CULTURE. THIS IS EVIDENT IN W! DANCE MUSIC AND ESPECIALLY IN THE MUCHONGOLD WHICH IS FEATURED IN THE RECORDINGS YOU HAVE HERE. THE NDAU CALL THE DANCE ""MUCHONGOYO,"" WHICH DERIVES FRCM THE NDAU WORD ""CHONGOYO,"" MEANING, ""STAMPING ONE'S FOOT IN PAIN."" BUT SOME ELDERS CLAIM THAT THE DANCE DEVELOPED FRCM AN NGUNI WAR DANCE CALLED ""IHUBO,"" SOMETIMES CALLED AMAHUBO OR MGUBO. ACCORDING TO SOME WRITTEN ACCOUNTS, THE IHUBO DANCE, BACK IN THE OLD DANS, WAS PERFORMED BY BATTALIONS OR REGIMENTS OF FIIGHTING YEN AND THAT THE SONGS ACCQJPANYING THE DANCING WERE MEANT TO BE SUNG BY AT LEAST A THOUSAND MEN TO BE REALLY EFFECTIVE, ESPECIALLY WITH THE SOUND OF A THOUSAND PAIRS OF FEET STAMPING AND SHAKING THE GROUND LIKE THUNDER. THE DANCE WAS DESCRIBED AS BEING n PERFORMED VERY SLOWLY BY THE NGUNI WARRIORS ELABORATELY DRESSED IN THEIR COLORFUL MILITARY DRESS. BUT THE PERFORMANCE OF THE MUCHONGOLO NOWADAYS IS VERY DIFFERENT. USUALLY THERE IS WHISTLING OR HORN-BLOWING TO SIGNAL THEY BEGINNING OF THE DANCE. THEN THERE IS SHOUTING AND mm EVERYBODY JOINS IN THE SINGING TO THE RHYTHM OF DRUMS OR JUST PLAIN HANDCLAPPING: CUT TWO: 3:45 COME IN FULL/ music fades at end of cut I SHOULD ADD THAT THAT PARTWCULAR REmRDING WAS MADE IN THE CITY OF MANISA. WELL THIS NEXT RECORDING,TOME, IS ALSO A PERFORMANCE OF THE MUCHOINOLO THATWAS DEVELOPED BY THE NDAU. IT'S CALLED THE MUCHONGOLO TUMBLING DANCE. THE DANCE IS ACROBATIC AND BERY HUMOROUS, DEWANDING CONSIDERABLE GYMNASTIC SKILL OF THE DANCERS. THE DRUM RHTYHMS ARE AKSO VERY COMPLEX: CUT THREE: 2:20 COME IN FULL/ music fades at end of cut WELL RITA, I SAID THAT SOME OLDER PEOPLE LIVING IN THE GAZA REGIONYCBAIMED THAT MUCHONGOLO ACTUALLY DEVELOPED FROM THE OLD REGIMENTAL DANCES OF THE NGUNI AND THAT WHEN IT WAS RERÃ¯Â¬Â‚HEI PERFORMED, HUNDREDS OF WARRIORS CARRYING SPEARSIXAND SHIELDS WOULD PARTICIPATE IN THE DANCING. FULL REGIMENTS OF MEN IN MELITARY DRESS WOULD COMPETE WITH EACH OTHER IN DISPLAYING THEIR DANCING SKILL. ALSO ACCORDING TO SOME HISTORICAL ACCOUNTS, WHEN THESE DANCES WERE PERFORMED IN THE

' l MUSIC TIME IN AFRICA MUSIC: VOICE: TOME: MAY 10, 1987 87Ã¢Â€Â”19 PAGE HTREE OLD DAYS, GIRLS WHO WERE BETROTHED TO THE YOUNG WARRIORS, WOULD ALSO CARRY SPEARS AND SHIELDS AND JOIN IN THE SINGING AND DANCING. WHAT WAS IMPORTANT IN THE DANCE WAS THAT ALL THE DANCERS HAD TO BE IN PERFECT UNITY. AN INTERESTING THING ABOUT IHUBO DANCE IS THAT IT WAS ALSO m PERFORMED BY LARGE GROUPS OF MEN RETURNING FROM A SUCCESSFUL HUNTING EXPEDITION, ESPECIALLY WHEN THEY KILLED A LION OR LEOPARD. OF COURSE, THIS WOULD ALL TAKE PLACE IN THE PRESENCE OF THE TRIBAL CHIEF WHO WOULD REWARD THE HUNTERS FOR THEIR SUCCESS. THIS NEXT RECORDING IS AN EXCELLENT EXAMPLE OF THIS. THE HUNTERS SING: YOU HEAR OF OUR FAMOUS MEN, WE ARE PROUD OF OUR FAME:"" CUT FOUR: Ã¢Â€Âœ:05 COME IN FULL/ music fades at end of cut TOME, THAT MUST HAVE BEEN A VERY SUCCESSFUL HUNTING.

LEO HAS SELECTED SOME TYPES OF FLUTE AND PIPE MUSIC FROM SOUTHERN, EASTERN AND CENTRAL AFRICA, AND, HE'S ALSO HERE WITH US THIS EVENING: THANK YOU RITA. I'M GOING TO BEGIN WITH MUSIC FROM BOTSWANA, IN SOUTHERN AFRICA THE TSWANA , LIKE THE VENDA AND SOTHO OF SOUTH AFRICA, ARE FAMOUS FOR THEIR LARGE ORCHESTRAS 0F REED FLUTES OR FLUTES MADE FROM METAL PIPES. THE FLUTES IN THESE ORCHESTRAS ARE 0F VARYING LENGTHS AND EACH FLUTE IS TUNED ACCORDING TO THE SOUND OF THE INSTRUMENT PLAYED BY THE LEADER OF THE GROUP. THE TUNING IS 'Ã¢Â€Âœ ' : -: Ã¢Â€Â˜. IS USUALLY DONE DURING THE MAKING OF THE INSTRUMENT. PROBABLY THE MOST INTERESTING THING ABOUT THESE FLUTE ORCHESTRAS IS THE FACT THAT EACH FLUTE PLAYER PLAYS ONLY ONE NOTE IN A MUSICAL PHRASE, USING ONLY ABOUT THREE, FOUR OR FIVE NOTES IN PHRSESS THAT ARE REPEATED. WHEN A DANCE IS ABOUT TO BEGIN, THE LEADER FIRST SOUNDS HIS NOTE AND THE OTHER PLAYERS COME IN AS THE TUNE REACHES THEIR PARTICULAR NOTE AND GRADUALLY THE WHOLE DANCE SPRINGS INTO LIFE AND Ill ALL THE PLAYERS Ill BECOME INIOLVED IN THE ACTION. BUT FIRST, RITA, I'LL GIVE YOU AN IDEA WHAT EACH FLUTE SOUNDS LIKE: MUSIC: CUT FOUR: 0:18 SECS THERE WERE ACTUALLY NINETEEN DIFFERENT NOTES THAT WERE SOUNDED IN THAT REEHRDXNE RECORDING, AND EACH BY A DIFFERENT MUSICIAN.

AND RIGHT NOW HERE""S LEO WITH MORE ABOUT THE INSTRUMENT AND SOME REGGREENGS HE'LL PLAY FOR US: - THANK YOU RITA, AND, JUST AS YOU ALREADY SAID, THE BOWL-LYRE INDEED DOES HAVE A LONG HISTORY OF EXISTENCE, ESPECIALLY IN NORTHEASEERN AND EASTERN AFRICAN CULTURES. EGYPTIAN PAINTINGS ABOUT 2000 YEARS B.C. SHOW MUSUETINS PLAYING LYRES. HISTORIANS SAY THAT THE LYRE WAS INTRODUCED INTO EGYPT BY Ac 2 SEMITIC NOMADS. RENE HISTORIANS ALSO NOTED THAT EGYPTIAN TRADERS HAD ALREADY PENETRATED THE REGIONS OF SUDAN AND EAST AFRICA As EARLY AS 2275 BC. SO MUSIC HISTORIANS ASSUME THAT THE TRAVELERS BROUGHT MUSICAL INSTRUMENTS WITH THEM DURING MIGRATIONS INTO THOSE REGIONS AND_DOWN AS FAR AS LAKE VICTORIA. PERHAPS THE MOST COMMON USAGE OF THE BOWLÃ¢Â€Â”LYRE Is IN THE PERFORMANCE OF PRAISE SONGS, MOST OF WHICH ARE XNRRUYXE IMPROVISED ON THE SPOT. WHETHER PRAISE SINGING IS IN WEST, EAST, CENTRAL OR SOUTH AFRICA, THE SONGS ARE BEHALLY ABOUT IMPORTANT PEOPLE, EVEN GLORIFYING THEM, ALTHOUGH MUSICIANS ALSO SING ABOUT CERTAIN EVENTS AND IMPORTANT HAPPENINGS. WHHT ABOUT THE INSTRUMENT ITSELF LEO. WHAT IS IT? FIRST OF ALL, THE INSTRUM,ENT IS A WOODEN BOWL COVERED WITH COWHIDE OR ZEBRA SKIN. IT HAS TWO WOODEN ARMS ATTACHED TO THEFACE OF THE INSTRUMENT IN THE SHAPE OF A ""v"", AND A WOODEN BAR CONNECTS THE TWO ARMS AT THE TOP. STRINGS ARE STRUNG FROM THE CROSS BAR DOWN ACROSS THE FACE OF THE BOWL, AND EACH STRING HAS ITS OWN TUNING KNOT ON THE CROSS BAR. THE KNOTS ARE MADE OF STRING AND CLOTH AND IT'S AMAZING HoquLL THIS TUNING SYSTEM WORKS AND CAN KEEP THE INSTRUMENT IN TUNE FOR A LONG PERIOD OF TIME: IT'S ALSO INTERESTING THAT THE STRINGS ARE STRETCHED OVER TWO BRIDGES, Ã¢Â€Â” A REAL ONE AND A FALSE ONE. THE REAL BRIDGE IS PLACED AT THE FOOT OF THE INSTRUMENT AND THE FALSE BRIDGE, USUALLY A FLAT PIECE OF CANE, IS PLACED AT THE CENTER OF THE FACE SO THAT IT PRODUCES A BUZZING SOUND WHEN THE XMSIIMMEN! STRINGS ARE PLUCKEDz' CUT THREE: 10 SECS Ã¢Â€Â˜ THAT BUZZING OR RATTLING SOUND IS VERY IMPORTANT BECAUSE IT SHOWS THAT THE INSTRUMENT IS WELLÃ¢Â€Â”MADE AND IS BEING WELLÃ¢Â€Â”PLAYED. BOWL-LYRES ARE MADE IN VARYING SIZES AND WITH DIFFERENT NUMBERS OF STEEXNESE STRINGS. FOR INSTANCE, IN KENYA THE LARGE OBUKANO OF THE KISII HAS TWELVE STRINGS. THE LITUNGU EXEHZKEERXNESX A MEDIUM SIZE INSTRUMENT, HAS EIGHT STRINGS, AND THE KIBUGANDET, A SMALLER TYPE BOWL LYRE HAS ONLY FIVE STRINGS. IHXMX THIS FIRST EXAMPLE NOW WAS RECORDED IN THE VILLAGE OF MASAKA IN UGANDA. TREXXNSTENNKENTHESXX THE INSTRUMENT HAS EIGHT STRINGEES AND IS CALLED AN ""ENDONGO."" THE SINGER

AT ABOUT THE SAME TIME, PEOPLE SPEAKING NILOTIC LANGUAGES MIGRATED SOUTHWARD FROM THE REGIONS OF THE NILE AND SETTLED IN AREAS THAT BECAME KENYA, UGANDA AND TANZANIA.

ONE OF THE IMPORTANT PEOPLES IN THE NORTHERN PART OF THE COUNTRY Is THE BARIBA, WHO HAVE ALWAYS MAINTAINED A RIGID TRADITIONAL SOCIETY AND HAVE ALSO RETAINED CERTAIN ANCIENT CEREMONIAL PRACTICES IN WHICH PROFESSIONAL MUSICIANS PLAY LEADING ROLES. OUR FIRST EXAMPLE OF MUSIC FROM BENIN IS A BARIBA PRAISE SONG, PERFORMED BY A PROFESSIONAL MUSIC GROUP A, KNOWN As ""SASAKO."" THIS TYPE OF MUSICAL GROUP,HsnxxxxxxEENHRxNXED BACK IN THE GOOD OLD DAYS, ACCOMPANIED WARRIORS ON HUNTING EXPEDITIONS.

IT IS USUALLY USED BY MEN WHO GUARD THE PLANTED FIELDS FROM BIRDS AND MONKEYS. ACTUALLY THE KENOU IS VERY SIMPLE. THE PLAYER SITS ON THE GROUND WITH HIS LEGS STRETCHED OUT. THEN HE LAYS FOUR PIECES OF WOOD ACROSS HIS LAP AND STRIKES THEM WITH A SMALL STONE IN EACH Ã¢Â€Â˜. HAND. THIS IS WHAT THE KENOU SOUNDS LIKE: Ã¢Â€Â™ MUSIC: CUT FIVE: 0:25 SECS % VOICE: YOU'RE LISTENING TO THE SOUNDS OF TRADITIONAL MUSIC FROM THE PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC Ã¢Â€Â˜ OF BENIN.

IT Is ONE OF THE OLDEST STATES ON THE AFRICAN CONTINENT AND HAS MORE THAN TWO THOUSAND YEARS OF RECORDED HISTORY.

YOHANNES: -------------- - gg VOICE: TO BEGIN WITH, HOW FAR BACK IN HISTORY Do WE GO WHEN TALKING ABOUT EEEIOPIAN MUSIC? LEO: WELL, FIRST I'D LIKE To MENTION THAT WHATEVER INFORMATION WE HAVE HERE ABOUT 1; ETHIOPIAN MUSIC COMES FROM MY COLLEAGUE, SHENAFI KEBEDE, WHO IS, AT THE PRESENT TIME, DIRECTOR OFD THE CENTER FOR BLACK CULTURE AT FLORIDA STSATE UNIVERSITY. HE'S ALSO THE AUTHOR OF THE BOOK ROOTS OF BLACK MUSIC."" ASHENAFI TELLS US THAT EHTIOPIAN WRITINGS REVEAL THAT IN THE SECOND MILLENIUM D.C., 5% THAT IS, TWO THOUSAND YEARSSBEFORE CHRIST, IMMIGRANT CUSHITES HAD ALREADY SETTLED IN ETHIOPIA AND DURING THE FIRST MILLENIUM D.C., A RACE OF PEOPLE FROM SOUTH WEST ARABIA, HAD SETTLED IN THE W NORTHERN REGION OF PRESENT DAY

r '3Ã¢Â€Âœ MUSIC TIME IN AFRICA FEB.9, 1986 86-6 PAGE TWO : ETHIOPIA.. THE LANGUAGE OF THOSE EARLY SETTLERS WAS GE'EZ, WHICH IS STILL THE LANGUAGE OF THE ETHIOPIAN CHURCH. DURING THE FIRST CENTURY AD THERE WAS A POWERFUL EMPIRE KNOWN As THE AXUMITE EMPIRE. FAMOUS TEMPLES AND PALACES, AND Ã‚Â« OTHER REMAINS SUCH AS COINS AND METALS BEAR WITNESS TO THE PRESENT DAY A GREAT w"" TECHNICAL SKILL AND ADVANCENEET. IT IS ALSO IMPORTANT TO MENTION HERE THAT ON THE AFRICAN CONTIBBBT, EEKIOPIA ALONE (with the exception of the arabian countries) HAD A SCRIPT AND WRITING SYSTEM OF ITS OWN. IN THE FOURTH CENTURY AD CHRISTIANITY WAS MADE THE Ã‚Â§Ã‚Â£yATE RELIGION OF THE AXUMITE EMPIRE. THE DECLINE OF Ã¢Â€Â˜III AXUMITE EMPIRE BEGAN DURING THE SEVENTH CENTURY AD AND THERE WAS A PERIOD OF WAR AND UNREST. THE ETHIOPIAN ORHTODOX CHURCH LEADERS THEN ATIEMPTED TO COMMUNICATE PRAYER THROUGH MUSIC. THIS WAS ALSO A PERIOD/RELIGIOUS AND CIVIL WARS AS A RESULT OF THE RAPID GROWTH OF ISLAM, so THERE WAS ALSO THE DEVELOPMENT OF A STYLE OF PATRIOTIC FOLK SONGS SISE BY SIDE WITH RELIGIOUS CHANTS AND DEVOTIONAL CHURCH MUSIC. DURING THE 12TH CENTURY, KING LALIBELA WAS THE MOST FAMOUS RULER IN ETHIOPIA AND IT IS SAID THAT HE ORGIIIZED A GUILD FOR MUSICIANS, LIKE A MUSICIANS'UNION WE HAVE NOWADAYS. IN THE 13TH CENTURY, AMHARIC, WHICH WAS ONCE A DIALECT OF THE ANCIENT GE'EZ LANGUAGE, BECAME THE OFFICIAL COURT LANGUAGE ANS/REMAINED AS THE LANGUAGE OF ETHIOPIA. DURIING THE 17TH CENTURY THERE WAS A REVITALIZTION OF TRASDITIONAL, RELIGIOUS, ARTISTIC AND CULTURAL INSTITUTIONS. RRanxnxxxxnxxunxxxxERIExxxxxnxnxxxxxuauuxunxxxxxxxuxxxuuxuxxxx Exnxnxxxxxxxxuzxxxxxx AMONG THE VARIOUS MUSICAL INSTRUMENTS IN EIHIOPIA, WHICH ONE IS THE MOST POPULAR AND BEST YOHANNES? YOHANNES: ---- m WELL, I Wag; SAY THAT THE KRAR IS PROBABLY THE BEST 5:3, KNOWN INSTRUMENT. Aw RITA: HOW DO YOU SPELL THAT WORD? YOHANNES: K-R-A-R. IT ACTUALLY MEANS ""STRINGED"", REFERRING To STRINGED INSTRUMENTS. THE KRAR Is TRIANGULAR IN SHAPE AND USUALLY HAS SIX STRINGS. THE SOUND Box IS USUALLY MADE FROM ANY TYPE OF METAL BOWL OR PAN, COVERED OVER BY A SHEEP OR GOAT SKIN. THE STRINGS OF THE KRAR TRADITIONALLY WERE GUT BUT NOHADAYS MANY KRARS USE NYLON, WIRE OR SILK STRINGS.. -A:.H:I.:Ã¢Â€Âœ':~r-Ã¢Â€Â” . =: e;RÃ¢Â€Â˜Tt e- Ã¢Â€Â™A-. ......... ----___-..-- ACTUALL, THERE ARE NO - WAYS 0F PLAYING THE KRAR, ONE BY MUTING THE STRINGS, THE OLD TRADITIONAL WAY. THE PLAYER'S LEFT HAND RESTS 0"" THE STRINGS TO DEADEN III OR MUFFLE THE IIIIII SOUND. THE OTHER WAY TO PLAY THE KRAR, WHICH IS THE PREFERRED WAY, IS BY PLUCKING THE STRINGS. IN THIS WAY THE MUSICIAN CAN CREATE HIGHLY ORNAMENTAL SOUND PATTERNS AND PRODUCE A ROMANTIC,, W; SENSUOS AND EXPRESSIVE MOOD.

I MUSIC TIME IN AFRICA FEB.9, 1986 86-6 PAGE THREE '~. : V8Ã‚Â§Ã¯Â¬ÂÃ‚Â§Ã‚Â§EÃ‚Â§HE OTHER IMPORTANT STRINGED INSTRUMENT IN ETHIOPIA IS THE ""MASINKO"", A TYPE 0F Ã¢Â€Â˜ M "" FIDDLE PLAYED WITH A BOW. THE ORIGIN OF THE MASINKO, OF COURSE, IS UNKNOWN BECAUSE IT IS PLAYED IN so MANY OTHER COUNTRIES AROUND THE HORN OF AFRICA, IN NORTH AFRICA AND IN THE MIDDLE EAST, AND THROUGHOUT ASIA. THE SOUND-BOX OF THE MASINKO 13 OF WOOD AND FORMED IN A DIAMOND-SHAPE. THE BOXXIS COVERED WITH COWHIDE AND THE INSTRUMENT HAS ONE STRING. AND THE STRINGS OF THE BOW ARE MADE FROM A STRANDS OF HORSE TAIL. THE FIVE FINGERS OF THE LEFT HAND ARE ALL USED To CHANGE :,T THE TONE WHILE PLAYING A MELODY. ACTUALLY , THE MASINKO IS USED FOR BOTH SECULAR : AND RELIGIOUS MUSIC, INCLUDING THE PERFORMAHEE AND ACCOMPANIMENT Iii WAR SONGS KNOWN AS SHELELA. MASINKo MUSIC IS ALMOST LIKE VOCAL MUSIC. THE PLAYERS TRY TO IMITATE THE TONAL SPEECH PATTERNS OF THE HUMAN VOICE JUST To SHOW HOW SKILLFUL THEY ARE. THIS EXAMPLE OF MASINKO PLAYING Is A VERY GOOD ONE BECAUSE' , 1 IT SHOWS A GREAT DEAL OF ORNAMENTATION: TL; MUSIC: CUT THREE: 2:Eo Ã¢Â€ÂœYf'g RITA: IN THIS ll ALBUM, TITLED ORHCESTRA ETHIOPIA WHICH LEO RECORDED IN ADDIS ABABA ,: Ã¢Â€Â˜13 SOME YEARS AGO, I LIKE THE SELECTION CALLED ""AMBASEL"" FEATURING THE WASHINT ,m "" FLUTE. : YOHANNES: WELL, AS YOU KNOW, IN MOST AGRICULTURAL COUNTRIES WHERE THERE ARE FLUTES, ORAL ,Ã¢Â€Â TRADITION CREDITS THE SHEPHERD FOR THE ORIGIN OF THE WASHING. IN ETHIOPIA, THE WASHINT IS CLOSELY IDENTIFIED WITH SHEPHERDS AND RECENTLY WITH WATCHMEN WHO KEEP AWAKE DURING THE LONG SLEEPLESS NIGHTS BY PLAYING THE FLUTE THE WASHINT IS USUALLY MADE FROM BAMBOO CANE IN VARYING LENGTHS. GENERALLY SPEAKING, THE WASHINT HAS A WARM, NATURAL TONAL QUALITY. A CREATIVE MUSICIAN CAN PLAY HIGHLY DECORATED AND ORNAMENTED TUNES.

ACTUALLY, WE RECORDED TWO SEPARATE SESSIONS WITH BROTHER KO-NIMO. FIRST IN ACCRA AND LATER IN KUMASI. KO-NIMO TOLD US THAT THE ONE THING HE'D LIKE TO BE REMEMBERED FOR IS HAVING GHANAIANS APPRECIATING THEIR OWNMUSIC AND TO CONTRIBUTE IN THE EVOLUTION OF THE GUITAR. HE ALSO IIXIXIHX REMINDED US THAT TRADITION IS EASILY FORGOTTEN BECAUSE MUCH OF IT IS ORAL AND IT WAS EXIRXIH FOR THAT REASON HE TOOK ON THE IMPORTANT TASK OF TRANSLATING ORAL TRADITION INTO WRITTEN FORM. FOR KO-NIMO, THE MEANING OF TRADITION LIES IN THE HEART OF A PEOPLE'S SPIRITUAL HEALTH. PEOPLE WHO FORGET THEIR CULTURE DON'T KNOW WHERE THEY BELONG AND THEY LOSE THEIR BEARING IN LIFE, HE SAID, AND THIS IS VERY DANGEROUS ESPECIALLY FOR THE YOUTH, BECAUSE IF THEY DON'T UNDERSTAND THEIR ROOTS THEY'LL LIVE TO REGRET IT. IS FRIENDS ARE THE OLD MEN AND WOMEN WHO TELL HIM STORIES AND TEACH HIM OLD PROVERBS AND ASHANTI ORAL HISTORY FROM WHICH HE COMPOSES THE LYRICS FOR MANY OF HIS SONGS. WE'RE GOING TO BEGIN NOW WITH THE RECORDING I WE MADE IN ACCRA WHERE WE FIRST MET BREE! BROTHER KO-NIMO:

THE PERFORMANCE OF AN ""NGODO"" USUALI TAKES ABOUT FORT!- FIVE MINUTES, DEPENDING ON THE ROUTINE OF THE DANCERS AND THE HOOD OF THE Ira-HEAT.

THE SUBJECT HATTER OF THE POETRT IS ALHAIS APPROPRIATE TO THE LOCALITY, ...IN ORDER TO BE ABLE TO UNDERSTAND THE NEINING OF THE NORDS OF THE SONGS, IOU WOULD HAVE TO BE INTOUCH wITH THE VILLAGERS AND THE ' REGIBN.

A PIECE OF BAMBOO IS PLACED VERTICALLY IN THE MIDDLE OF THE STEM AND THAT ACTS AS A BRIDGE TO HOLD THE STRINGS, FORMING A DOUbLE TRIANHEE. THE TENSION OF EACH STRING IS REGULATED BY MEANS OF A RING WHICH SLIDES ALONG TH STEM. A CALABASH ATTACHED TO THE MIDDLE IF THE MVET IS PRESSED AGAINST THE CHEST OF THE MUSICAN WHILE HE REHEHE THE STRINGS WITH THE FINGERS OF BOTH HANDS. THERE ARE CALABASHS ATTACHED TO EACH END OF THE STEM. ANOTHER INSTERESTING NOTE IS THAT DURING SOME OF THE PERFORMANCES, WHECH SOMETIMES LAST ALL NIGHT, PEOPLE IN THE AUDIENCE TAKE PART BY SINGING CERTAIN PASSAGES OF WELLÃ¢Â€Â”KNOWN POEMS: CUT FIVE: 2:30 COME IN FULL WITH MUSIC

THANK YOU, RITA, AND THANK YOU FRIENDS FOR JOINING US THR TODAY'S MUSIC TIME IN AFRICA PROGRAM. THE RECORDINGS I HAVE HERE ARE FROM THE REPUBLIC OF NIGER IN WEST AFRICA. BUT BEFORE THE MUSIC I'D LIKE TO MENTION A FEW IMPORTANT FACTS FOR THOSE WHO MAY NOT BE FAMILIAR WITH THE COUNTRY. NIGER IS THE TENTH LARGEST COUNTRY IN AFRICA AND IT TAKES ITS NAME FROM THE NIGER RIVER WHICH FLOWS- THROUGH THE SOUTHWEST PART OF THEXEEHNT ITS TERRITORY. AN INTERRSTING NOTE IS THAT THE NAME NIGER DERIVES FROM THE TAMASHEK LANGUAGE OF THE TUAREG PEOPLE. THE WORD IS FROM A PHRASE MEANING ""RIVER AMONG RIVERS."" GEOGRAPHICALLY, THE COUNTRY IS DESCRIBED AS BEING LANDLOCKED, THAT IS, IT HAS NO ACCESS TO THE SEA. L. <2. ""a-KOTO-NING-ai

MUSIC TIME IN AFRICA o MUSIC: RITA: FEB. 5, 198A 8AÃ¢Â€Â”6 PAGE Two NIGER Is BOUNDED BY ALGERIA ON THE NORTHWEST, BY LIBYA ON THE NORTHEAST, BY CHAD ON THE EAST, BY NIGERIA AND BENIN ON THE SOUTH AND ON THE NEST BY UPPER VOLTA AND MALI. NIAMEY IS THE CAPITOL CITY AND LIES ON THE BANKS OF THE NIGER RIVER. THE LARGEST LINGUISTIC GROUP IS FORMED BY THE HAUSA, ABOUT 85% of the COUNTRY'S INHABITANTS UNDERSTAND HAUSA. SONGHAI IS THE SECOND MOST IMPORTANT LANGUAGE AND IS DIVIDED INTO VARIOUS DIALECTS, SUCH AS JARMA AND DENDI. AS I MENTIONED EARLIER, TAMASHEK IS THE LANGUAGE OF THE TUAREG WHO LIVE IN THE GREAT SAHARA DESERT AND IN THE FOOTHILLS OF THE MYSTERIOUS AIR MOUNTAINS IN THE NORTHWESTERN PART 0 F THE COUNTRY. NIGER FORMS PART OF THE VAST SAHELIAN CULTURAL REGION OF WEST AFRICA AND LAYS CLAIM TO A SHARE IN THE PROUD HISTORIC HERITAGE OF THE WEST AFRICAN SUDAN REGION. ALTHOUGH THE INFLUENCE OF ISLAM IS RR] PREDOMINANT, PRE~ISLAMIC CULTURAL TRADITIONS ARE ALSO VERY STRONG END IN EVIDENCE EVERYWHERE. AMONG THE NONnMIGRATING PEOPLES NF NIGER, THE CHIEF MUSIC MAKERS ARE THE GRIOTS, BUT THERE ARE ALSO REGIONAL CULTURAL TROUPES OF DANCERS AND MUSICIANS WHO PERFORM REGULARLY IN CULTURAL COMPETITIONS AND DURING FESTIVE OCCASIONS. ALRIGHT, NOW, HERE'S THE MUSIC. THIS FIRST RECORDING IS A SONG IN JARMA LANGUAGE. THE SINGER IS ACCOMPANIED BY A BAMBOO FLUTE CALLED BULU, AND A SMALL LUTE CALLED KONDIGI: CUT THREE: 2:00 COME IN FULL WITH MUSIC: Ã¢Â€Â˜ THIS NEXT RECORDING OF MUSIC FROM THE REPUBLIC OF NIGER COMES FROM TAHOUA, THE COUNTRY'S THIRD LARGEST CITY. YOU'LL HEAR A LARGE GROUP OF HAUSA GIRLS SING T0 OF A BULU FLUTE, DRUMS AND HANDCLAPPING: CUT FOUR: 2:00 YOU'RE LISTENING TO MUSIC TIME IN AFRICA ON VOA'S AFRICA SERVICE. I'M RITA ROCHELLE AND WITH/YE YOUR VOA MUSICMAN, LEO, TELLING US SOMETHING ABOUT THE COUNTRY OF NIGER ITS PEOPLE AND ABOUT THEIR MUSIC. WE PLAYED EXAMPLE.OF FOLK SONGS OF THE JARMA AND THE HAUSA, AND NOW, HERE'S LEO WITH MORE MUSIC: THANK YOU AGAIN RITA. NEXT WE'LL LISTEN TO MUSIC OF THE TUAREG WHO LIVE IN THE DESERT REGIONS OF THE NORTHWEST PART OF THE COUNTRY. LITTLE IS KNOWN OF THE ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE TUAREG TRIBES. THERE ARE NO PROFRESSIONAL TUAREG

A FEW BLACKSMITHS OR SERVANTS OCCASIONALLY TURN THEIR TALENT FOR SINGING TO SOME PROFIT BUT THIS IS THE EXCEPTION RATHER THAN THE RULE. AMONG THE TUAREG, MUSIC IS PERFORMED BY BOTH MEN AND WOMEN, BUT THEY SPECIALIZE IN QUITE DIFFERENT TYPES. ALTHOUGH THERE ARE SONGS PERFORMED BY MALE SINGERS WITHOUT ACCOMPANIMENT, IT FREQUENTLY HAPPENS THAT THE SINGER ISD ACCOMPANIED BY A WOMAN PLAYING A 0NE_STRING FIDDLE, CALLED THE INZAD. THE INSTRUMENT IS A HALF-SHELL OF A GOURD COVERED WITH A PIECE OF GOATSKIN, AND HAS A SINGLE STRING MADE OF HORSEHAIR, AND PLAYED WITH A SMALL BOW. THIS IS WHAT THE INZAD SOUNDS LIKE: CUT FIVE: 0:45 SECS THERE IS A LARGE NUMBER OF PURELY INSTRUMENTAL TUNES PLAYED ON THE INZAD AND IN MOST CASES THEY ARE ADAPTATIONS OF WELLÃ¢Â€Â”KNOWN VOCAL SONGS. THIS FINAL EXAMPLE OF MUSIC FROM NIGER IS AN INSTRUMENTAL ADAPTATION OF A POPULAR TUAREG LOVE SONG. HERE THE TUNE IS PLAYED ON A GUITAR BY BOUBAKAR MUSA: CUT SIX: 2:25 WELL THANK YOU AGAIN LEO, IT WAS NICE HAVING YOU WITH US.

THIS RECORDING FEATURES FOLK MUSIC OF THE YOGO, AND HERE'S YOUR VOA MUSICMAN TO TELL US WHAT THE MUSIC IS ALL ABOUT: THANK YOU RITA. THIS RECORDING WAS MADE DURING THE PERFORMANCE OF A VERY OLD AND ANCIENT FOLK DANCE THAT IS KRARELY SEEN THESE DAYS. IT'S A CIRCULAR DANCE FOR BOTH MEN AND WOMEN AND CALLED ""EBI"". THERE ARE SEVERAL VARIATEONS OF THE DANCE BUT ALL OF THEM ACTUALLY FOLLOW A GENERAL PATTERN...THAT IS, THE MEN FORM A CIRCLE IN SINGLE FILE AND DANCE ANTIÃ¢Â€Â”CLOCKWISE...WHILE THE WOMEN, ALSO EH-ehhhhhh"" FRANCO LEO

THE ACCOMPANYING DRUM ORCHESTRA REMAINS ON THE OUTSIDE OF THE CIRCLE OF DANCERS. IN THIS PARTICULAR RECORDING, THE DRUM GROUP CONSISTED OF TWO WOODEN SLIT DRUMS,EKXEEE EMEHXMHEH THREE CONE~SHAPED DRUMS CALLED ""n'DIMA"" AND TWO METAL AXE BLADES.

AND A FINAL NOTE ABOUT THE DANCE ITSELF.... THE MOST ATTRACTIVE FEATURE, IN THE GOOD OLD DAYS, WAS THE BRIGHT SCARLET HEADRESSESS OF THE DANCERS, MADE FROM THE TAIL FEATHERS OF THE CONGOLESE GREY PARROT. AND THE FEATHERS WERE ALSO A GREAT TREASURE BECAUSE THEY REPRESENTED NEEETK WEALTH AND SOCIAL POSITION IN THE TRIBE AND USED AS PART OF THE PAYMENT FOR A BRIDE'S DOWRY OR LOBOLO. VOICE: WELL THANK YOU FOR THAT DESCRIPTION MISTER MUSICMAN ..,NOW WE CAN IMAGINE AND PICTURE IN OUR MINDS WHAT THE EBI DANCE MAY HAVE LOOKED LIKE WHEN IT WAS PERFORMED.

MUSIC TIME IN AFRICA c MUSIC: VOICE: l MUSIC: I VOICE: JAN.15, 1983, 84Ã¢Â€Â”3 PAGE Two ARE MUSIC AND ORAL LITERATURE. MUSIC PLAYS A SIGNIFICANT SOCIAL AND RELIGIOUS ROLE IN SENEGALESE SOCIETY. SPECIFIC SONGS, MELODIES AND KINDS OF MUSIC HAVE SPECIAL PURPOSES, AND THERE ARE STRICT RULES GOVERNING WHEN AND BY WHOM THEY MAY BE PERFORMED. AMONG THE TRADITTONAL MUSICAL INSTRUMENTS IN SENEGAL, PROBABLY THE MOST COMMON INSTRUMENT IS THE HALAM, OR KHALAM, A TYPE OF LUTE OF WHICH THERE ARE THREE VARIETIES THAT DIFFER IN SIZE AND MUSICAL RANGE. ALL HAVE RESONATORS, USUALLY MADE OF WOOD, OR GOURDS OVER WHICH TANNED COWHIDE HAS BEEN STRETCHED. ALL BUT ONE HAS FIVE STRINGS. THIS INSTRUMENT IS SIMILAR TO THE LUTE WHICH DOMINATES THE MUSIC OF THE SONGHAI IN MALI, OR THE KONNI OF THE MANDINGO, OR EVEN THE TIDINIT OF THE MOORISH GRIOTS IN MAURETANIA. THE INSTRUMENT IS A WOODEN SOUNDBOX, OR A GOURD SOUNDBOX WITH A SKIN STRETCHED OVER IT. THE NECK OF THE INSTRUMENT ISA WOODEN STICK FIXED INTO THE SOUNDBOX UNDER THE SKIN, AND THE STRINGS ARE STRETCHED OVER A BRIDGE UP TO THE TIP OE THE WOODEN POLE. THE MOST CHARACTERISTIC THING ABOUT THE INSTRUMENT IS THE METHOD OF PLAYING IT.

HISTORICAL RECORDS SHOW THAT THE CRAFT OF MAKING TIMBILA XYLOPHONES AND THE ART OF GROUP PLAYING HAD ALREADY BEEN WELL-ESTABLISPED BY THE CHOPI AS FAR BACK AS THE EARLY SIXTEENTH Ã¢Â€Â™ 1.33 ABOUT THE CENTURY.

ACTUALLY, VERY LITTLE IS KNONN ABOUT THOSE ANCIENT MIGRATIONS, BUT MOVEMENTS OF VARIOUS PEOPLES IN THE LAST SEVERAL HUNDRED YEARS HAVE RESULTED IN A GREAT ETHNIC DIVERSITY WITH THE INTERMINGLING AND ASSIMILATION OF MORE THAN m TWO HUNDRED ETHNIC GROUPS. THERE ARE AT LEAST TWENTY-FOUR MAJOR LANGUAGES AND MANY DIALECTS AMONG THE SIX MILLION PEOPLE IN CAMEROON. TRADITIONALLY, MUSIC AND DANCE FORMED A PART OF EVERY RELIGIOUSfr AND SOCIAL OCCASION. BIRTHS, INITIATION RITES, WEDDINGS, FUNERALS AND EVEN EVENTS WERE EACH ASSOCIATED WITH A WITH PARTICULAR DANCE AND X CORESSPONDING MUSICAL ACCOMPANDENT. THE CHARACTERISTIC Oi;di3! STYLE OF TRADITIONAL VOCAL MUSIC IS ""CALL AND RESPONSE"".. .THAT IS, A SCAG LEADER ALTERNATES WUTH A CHORUS. INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC IS USUALLY POLYRHYTHMICAL AND DOMINATED BY PERCUSSION INSTRUMENTS, WHICH INCLUDE XYLOPHONES, BELLS, RATTLES, AND MANY KINDS OF DRUMS. OTHER INSTRUMENTS IN CAMEROONIAN TRADITIONAL MUSIC ARE WHISTLES, FLUTES, BAMBOO, METAL AND WOODEN HORNS, AND STRINGED INSTRUMENTS THAT HAVE CALABASH RESONATORS. THIS FIRST RECORDING IS FROM OUR COLLECTION OF MUSEC FROM THE SOUTH CENTRAL PROVINCE OF CAMEROON FEATURING A XYLOPHONE ORCHESTRA OF THE BETI WHO LIVE IN THAT REGION: MUSIC: CUT THREE: 2:25 LEO: THAT WAS MUSIC FROM THE SOUTH CENTRAL PROVINCE OF CAMEROON I HAVE AN EXAMPLE NON FROM THE NORTHWESTERN PART OF CAMEROON.

TODAY WE'RE GOING TO TALK ABOUT IQUSIC IN GHANA EU WITH ME IS MY COILEAGUE, LEO SARKISIAN, YOUR VOA MUSICMAN I THANK YOU RITA, AND HELLO FRIENDS. AS YOU KNOW, FROM TIME TO TIME IÃ¢Â€Â˜TE'VE FEATURED MUSICAL INSTRUMENTS AND SINGING STYLES OF SOME OF T HE VARIOUS PEOPLES (sneak music here) IN GHANA. . .THE DRUNS OF ado-WA, HORNS AND FLUTES, AND FOR EXAMPLE LIKE THIS MUSIC FOR adente-BEN CUT THREE: 0:20 SECS ALSO AMONG THE MANY FOLK INSTRUMENTS IN GHANA, THERE ARE MUSICAL BOWS RAFT ZITHERS HARPS, BOWED AND PLUCKED LUTES: CUT FOUR: 0:20 SECS ' Ã‚Â«j THERE ARE SOME MUSICAL INSTRUMENTS PLAYED ALONE AS SOLO INSTRUMENTS OR IN 3;: ENSEMBLES HWEVER, IT IS NOT UNCOMIÃ¢Â€Â˜EON 'IU FIND THEM COMBINED WI TH VOICE. FOR EWLE, Ã¢Â€Â˜EHERE IS SINGING THAT GOES WITH ado_WA DRUMMING OR WITH agba-JA (3136333 A A FULL PEBFCRIÃ¢Â€Â™IANCE OF ANY OF THESE WOULD INCLUDE BOTH pa-CHA a-WA kambo-WANG TO OF THE MUSICAL TYPES FOUND IN VARIOUS PARTS OF GHANA. DRUMS AND VOICES, AND PERHAPS BELLS, 0R RATTLES OR BOTH: CUT FIVE: 0:31. SECS WHAT I SAID ABOUT DRUMS IS ALSO TRUE OF OTHER INSTRUMENTS IT IS USUAL FOR PERFORMEIIIM OF STRINGED INSTRUMENTS To SING As THEY ARE PLAYING. IN SPITE OF THE FACT THET THE XYLOPHONE IS CAPABLE OF EXPLOITING BOTH RHYTHMEC AND MELODIC RESOURCES TO AN EQUALLI HIGH DEGREE, ONE NOULD FIND IT, NOW AND THEN, SUPDORTING OR LEADING A CHORUS. IT IS OBVIOUS, THEREFORE, FROM THE WIDESPREAD TENDENCY TO COMBINE INSTRUMENTS AND VOICES, THAT VOCAL MUSIC HAS CONSIDERABLE IMPORTANCE IN LOCAL CULTURE AND DESERVES PARTICULAR ATTENTION IF ONE WISHES TO UNDERSTAND THE PRACTICE OF TRADITIONAL MUSIC IN GHANAIAN SOCIETIES. THERE ARE.

, MUSIC TIME IN AFRICA MU SI C : LEO VOICE : MUSIC: LEO VOICE: MUSIC: i MAY 1, 1983 83Ã¢Â€Â”18 PAGE TINT/E III? 0?. TA NT TxÃ¢Â€Â˜JO/THIIÃ¢Â€Â˜IGS THAT SHOULD BE COIÃ¢Â€Â˜ICIDVJRI'JD IN VOCAL MUSIC FIRST, CONCERNING THE TUNE, THE KIND OF SCALE IT USES, THE KIND OF VOICE QUALITIES UEFD, AND THE TECHNIQUES OF VOICE PRODUCTION, OR THE KIND OF SINGING STYLE TIE-ETLOYED. FOR EXAMPLE, THE SINGING STYLE OF FRAFRA IS QUITE DIFFERENT FROM THAT OF THE AKAN. . . BOTH OF TIÃ¢Â€Â˜IEIÃ¢Â€Â˜E USE DI FERENT SCALES. ANYOIÃ¢Â€Â˜IE TRAVELING IN GHANA WOULD IÃ¢Â€Â˜ULÃ¢Â€Â˜ET THIS EDRT OF THING IN DIFFERENT ARIÃ¢Â€Âœ S. IT WOULDNÃ¢Â€Â™T TAKE LONG TO RECOGNIZE DAGARTI SINGING AND DI STINGUISH IT FROM DAGBANI SINGING CR KONKOMBA SINGING. SO IN VOCAL MUSIC, THE TUNE POSES ITS OWN PROBLEI'JS OF UNDERSTAIÃ¢Â€Â˜UDING ANB APPRECIATIDNN THESE PROBLEMS ARE SCI/EMT INDEPENDENT OF THE PROBLEM OF LANGUAGE WHICH IS THE OTHER ASPECT W TO BE CONSIDERED WHEN TALKING ABOUT VOCAL MUSIC. FOR EXAMPLE, IN THE MUSIC OF THE AREA IN GHANA, THERE (sneak music here) HERE IS A RECORDING FROM THE ANGLO TUNGU ARE TWO DIFFERENT SINGING STYLES. AREA: CUT SIX: 0:20 SECS NON, LISTEN TO THIS RECORDING FRCIVI KPANDU AREA IN GHANA: CUT SEVEN: 0:18 SECS THE DIFFERENCE BETIÃ¢Â€Â™JEEN THE TWO RECORDINGS YOU JUST HEARD IS NOT THE LANGUAGE, THEY WERE PRACTICALLY THE SAFE, . ..IF SDNEONE FROM THE HO-KPANDU AREA FINDS IT DIFFICULT TO APPRECIATE ANGLO MUSIC, IT WOULD BE ON MUSICAL GROUNDS, .THE VAST DIFFERENCE IN THE TONES THAT ARE SELECTED AND USED AS A BA$S OF THE SONGS AND THE TYPICAL PATTERNS lIN WHICH THEY ARE USED. 30, ALTHOUGH THE TWO GROUPS HAVE A COMMON SPOKEN LANGUAGE FOR SOCIAL PURPOSES, WEN IT COMES TO MUSIC THEY USE DIFFERENT MUSICAL IANGUAGES. THE OPPOSITE CASE NON, OF GHANIANS WHO SPEAK DIFFERENT LANGUAGES BUT WHO SHARE A COMMON MUSICAL LANGUAGE. FOR E viPLE, LETÃ¢Â€Â˜S COMPARE THE MUSICAL LANGUAGE OF THE EWE OF THE HO-KPANDU AREA AND THE MUSIC OF THE AKAN, THE GHANG, THE GA GR SPEAKERS OF NON-EWE LANGUAGES IN THE EWE REGION, SUCH m PLACES AS CENTRA KOVI, JASSICA, AND SO FORTH. LISTEN TO THESE TWO RECORDINGS. HERE IS THE FIRST ONE: CUTEIGHT: 0:20 SECS EWE

IÃ¢Â€Â”iUSICIANS IN THEPAST MERE NOT ONLY POETS RHO EXPRESSED THEIR THOUGHTS AND FEELINGS IN THEIR SONGS, THEY WERE CRITICS NHO GAVE OUT PRAISE OR BLAME, BECAUSE THEY HERE SENSITIVE TO WHAT WENT ON ABOUT THEY HERE, TO SOME EXTENT, PEOPLE WEIL;VERSED IN THE TRADITIONS OF THEIR CULTURE, AND THEY KNEW THE GENEAOLOGIES OF KINGS, AND COULD RECITE THESE ON DRUMS OR SING THEM IN PRAISE POEMS OR MOURNFUL SONGS. THEY HISTORIANS OF A SORT AND KEPT THE CHRONICLES OF THE STATE. IN THE DAGOMBA AREA OF GHANA, THERE ARE PEOPLE WHO HAVE KEPT THE ANCIENT TRADITIONS. . . .THE DAGBANI GONJE PLAYERS AND SINGERS WHO CHANT TO THE RHYTHM OF HOURÃ¢Â€Â”GLASS SHAPED DRUMS ARE STILL VERY GOOD AT THIS....AND So ARE THE HASTm DRUMMERS WHO PLAY THE FAI-IOUS ATUMPAN DRUMS: CUT TEN: 0:20 SECS AND NON THIS FINAL EXAMPLE OF GHANAIAN MUSIC IS MUSIC FOR THE DANCE CALLED ado-WA.

They hand down, orally of course, from generation to generation the techniques of their craft Ã¢Â€Â” especially the instrumental techniques. VOICE: What are the main musical instruments used by these profressional musicians, Leo? Leo: Well, in the first place, there are two main instruments played by the Moorish griots - the TIDINIT and the ARDIN. The TIDINIT winch _appears to be reserved for men, is a four-stringed lute - it sounds like this: . MUSIC: OUT ON E 0:20 Leo: It has a wooden sound-box with a skin stretched over it. The neck of the instrument is simply a wooden stick, a pole fixed into the soundbox under the skin. The strings are stretched over a bridge nd fixed at one end to the tip of the neck and at the other end to leather rings round the neck proper. The strings are tuned by moving the leather ringer Most musicians usually add small bells to the tip of the neck pole, or even small metal chains that rattle while the musician is playingo But probably the most characteristic thing about the instrument is the method of playing - that is, the musician simultaneiously taps the stretched skin of the sound-box with his_right thumb while playing to mark the rhyhtmo : CUT Two: 0:10 : Xou said, Leo, that the instrument, the TIDINIT , appears to be reserved for men. Does that mean the women griots have their own .Special musical instrument? LGO:. Exactly, Sue. The second main instrjnent in Mauretanian CS snipe is the ARDIN - played by the Moorish women griots. The Ardin is actually a harp with about 10 strings - I'm saying ""abput"" because

The next is called ""LEBIADH"", meaning ""white"", and the m I third is called ""ZRAG"", the spotted styleÃ‚Â° Now, each of these : g3 styles, or ""ways"" of playing has its own sequence of different V Qt modes.

MUSIC TlME IN AFRICA Leo: SUNDAX FEB.27, 1972 page A in the same scopeÃ‚Â° It is often difficult to determine the actual mode ampmzmxmmÃ¯Â¬Â‚xmmmix in which a piece of music is being playedo l is There are at least four principal modes within each of the three styles of musicÃ‚Â° The modes are known as KARR, VAGHO, SEINIMA and BEIGI The first song you just heard was played in the KARE mode. But it gets more complex when you consider the styles of music gear in which a mode is playedÃ‚Â° The name of the mode changes - depending in which style it's playeda That is, if the mode KARR is played in the black style, it's called, ""N'TEMASS. In the white style of playing, it's called MEKKE-MUSA and the same KARR scale played in the spotted style would be called ""NOUEFEL 0 So you see, Sue, it can get very complexo Actually, each mode or scale in Moorish music is characterized not only by its particular musical contents, but also by the circumstancem, tbemes and needs with which it is conventionally connectedo ?or example, the mode ""KARR is I linked with the idea of gladness and joy Ã¢Â€Â” the mode VAGHO with the theme or circumstance of war and the idea of courage, strength and pride. The mode SEINIMA is associated with a number of more complex black and white styles while the mode BEIGI is connected with nostalgia, melancholy or lamenta I'm really amazed Leo how much there is to this music, - now that you've explained something about it. Yet, I shouldn't be surbrised becauseÃ¢Â€Â˜l've heard you speak so many times about the richness which exists in African traditional musicÃ‚Â° Andm I think it's time for more music: Okay, Sue, here's the second sarhsx recording of Mauretanian Ã¢Â€Âœ331cc LLÃ¢Â€Âœ; ""J deaths: gahous Moorish musician m tho-oileocacea :3 in; %%

It has, Sue, especially in its conception of modes, yet it is still difficult to determine under what conditions, when and how it came under this influence. It is very probable that the Berbers and certain African peoples have also played a part in the formation and development of Moorish music as it is today. Fur musical analysis would surely throw some light on In this next recording, we hear another celebrated griot musician playing the TIDINIT and singing in the VAGHO mode. _ A concert of Moorish music almost inVariably begins with a sort of instrumental introduction, during which the griot adjusts the tuning of the instrument, getting into the mass mood of the nhosen mode: h:30 That bit of Moorish music was played and sung by a well-known _ CUT ""1Ã¢Â€Â”Ã¢Â€Â˜T77'1 :4 J. vi; griot musician from the town of MEDERDRA, gnanasenthanÃ¯Â¬Â near .l the moment, very little is known -Ã‚Â» nystematic and thorough this subjecto *3 $6: 5Ã¢Â€Â˜9

KKKXXKK Do the musicians imprgyise the verses they (:3 . sing or are these wall'known songs, Leo? The words of songs are almost always verses learnt by heartÃ‚Â° It's very rare that a griot would improvise the words of a song as he singsÃ‚Â° Actually, these musicians can develop a whole song from just a few verses, prolong a syllable or even confine himself to the repitition of a very brief phrase. The expressive nature of a poem, the themes which it develops and its metrical structure often correspond precisely to the musical ""mode"" or scale, just as the theme and mode do in this last recording you have here. This is an excelent recording, by the way. It was recorded in the camp of the Emir of Tagant, east of Nouakchott, in the central part of the country. Several of the the mode VAGHO of Emirs musicians perform "" ard course must be used. This is the mode that is linked with the ride theme of war and the idea of courage, strength and 'U D accompaniment in this recording is the TBOL drum and the DAGHUMMA, a long, hollowedÃ¢Â€Â”out calabash. The DAGHUMMA calabash Ã‚Â» is open at each end and skillfully manipulated so that the palm of the hand and the thigh tap against the Openings to produce the gunman rhythmic soundso The instrument often has a necklace coiled around the calabash a in this case, the sound of the necklace striking the calabash like a rattle makes more noise than than the air vibrating inside.

Of course, this has been going on for some time, and probably one of the reasons is the effect of the present-day recording industry. Many musicians and composers of both popular and jazz music have a very high.rcgard for the musical heritage of Africa, And are drawing more than erer on the sources of African folkmusic for their exciting rhythms and melodies. American jazz musician, Abdul-Malik, for example, after a visit to Nigeria and Ghana, arranged a Ghanaian tune in its authentic hi-life structure and beat: MUSIC: CUT ONE: 6:35 SECS: Herbie Mann, who trekked through Africa for weeks, listening, VOICE: observing and studying the fascinating_fisld of African folkmusic MM.Ã¢Â€Âœ buw .....A ~_.Ã¢Â€Â™... x.- . .

It's Music Time 2: in Africa: THEME: 10 SECS: UNDER AND OUT: Ã¢Â€Â˜ VOICE: Zambia is the country we are going to visit today and it's the musiÃ‚Â« of the Bemba-speaking people being featured. The Babemba, as the people are called, live in the northern and Luapula regions of Zambia. The Zambian writer Cajetan Lunsonga tells us in his notes Ã¢Â€Â™ on the history of these pebple that the Bemba-speaking tribes seem } to have come from one principal stem and that as they came down i from the north, they had to conquer others whom they met on the way. When they reached the Luapula river some of the principal tribal chiefs decided to remain along the riVer's valley, while others pushed forward for a better settlement. Ensuing tribal were brought about mixtures in language and cultural traditions. In the musical traditions of the Babemba, songs are divided into various sections depending on the types of festivals or occasions in the life cycle and time circle of these people. There are songs for w \ v birth of twins and on such occasions, women, especially, perform a lot of dances and singing. Singing and dancing take place for l

First for the wedding eve - when the days of waiting for th: wedding day get less, they start to prepare millet for making beer. and all sorts of foods that would be required for the wedding. People sing continuously during all these activities and then on a the wedding day, the bride it taken separately from the groom to learn the ways of performing marriage. They are not taught verbally but all is done through dances, special songs and other traditional customs. Beer drinking, dances and singing take nhnn place when the newly married woman conceives and there is/zpecial xungxminxÃ¯Â¬Âug set of tunes sung during the preparations arranged for the arrival of a new baby. As in most other parts of Africa there are the special funeral songs - both for before and after burial occasions. In Bemba customs, deaths are classified and special homage is paid to each type, and there are songs also for the renewalÃ¢Â€Â”of-villageÃ¢Â€Â”fire ceremonies. After burying, all return to the village and clean their houses or smear them, then take out everything and the fires are extinguished. The Headman of that Village orders that no marriage activities be done that night. With his village crafts, he makes a new fire and all go to take from that new fire. There are many more types of Bemba music like the songs for defeating a battle, killing a lion, crowning a chief and the music for different tribal dances, but first let's listen to a medley of two pretty Memba tunes by Musonda and Simwinga, old tunes recorded some years back, but still nice to listen to Ã¢Â€Â” they're love: songs and of course about beautiful girls: CUT 1 6:00 x

And because Africa today is more aware of its folkmussc than ever before, traditional musical instruments have now appeared alongside the guitar in the many groups now engaged in modern musicÃ¢Â€Â”making. Highlife bands in Ghana and Nigeria have been making excellent use of the famous talking drums in their musical arrangements - in Senegal, for example, one can hear the ancient and majestic African harp, the Kora, playing along side modern western musical instruments."" recent musical journey to the Republic of Cameroon, our MKKXKNXJ During a E 2 Musicman Leo Sarkisian listened to a number of dance orchestras ,_Ã¢Â€Â playing folksongs and using traditional African instruments - he i '. told 1h us that he was especially impressed by the use of . es and thnnxaxnanx drums of various sizes.

It's Music Time in Africa: 16 SECS: UNDER AND OUT: Today we're going to listen to music from the western part of the Ivory Coast - music of the Dan people, who number about 200 thousand in the Ivory Coast, and another 100 thousand across the border in Liberia, where they are called Gio. Most of the area where the Dan live, is divided between equatorial forest and mountainous places where many peaks rise over 2000 feet. The Dan, like all West African forest dwellers, are planters. Their chief nourishment is is rice, which they grow, on steep slopes. Meat is not eaten very much, as domettic animals like chickens, sheep, goats and cattle are only slaughtered for special faith: feasts. So hunting and fishing are pretty important, if there's to be any meat eaten at all. In the early days, each headÃ¢Â€Â”man of a Dan village had a number of musicians on his personal staff. Trained ""- singers, drummers and trumpeters formed groups that played at the: chief's official appearances, accompanied him on journeys, and in} general increased his prestige.

It used to be that these musicians page 2 {'played only in honor of the chief -- but now they take part in all kinds of festivities, and our first number today is performed by hust such a group. It consists of ten singers. One soloist alternates with a second, who breaks in with loud interruptions. The other eight, forming a chorus, keep repeating the same motif. A ratlle made from a calabash, and two chains of brass rings, accompany the singing: MUSIC: CHIEF'S SONG: .Cut 1 4:00 VOICE: That was music for a chief, by singers of the Dan tribe in the western part of the Ivory Coast. The word ""TA"" in the Dan language means not only dancing, but also singing, and instrumental music.- Practically everything that goes on, provides an occasion for dancing. Apart from the great final ceremonies, that is, the burial and funeral rites, the most important events are the ceremonies that mark the transition from childhood to full adult status in the community. Here now are three drummers playing at a large coming-of-age festival in the north of the Dan country. Several boys are dancing, to the rhythm of the drums. Two of the drummers come right from right there in the village. The chief drummer is not of the Dan tribe, but has settled down among them, and has built up quite a reputation. His instrument consists of a one-skin drum to which he has attached four smaller drums -- this OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO way he can play his rhythms at various levels of pitch.

The girld enter the village . meetingÃ¢Â€Â”place, holding up swords as they dance, and they're accomoanied by three drummers playing the hour-glass pressure-type drums.

The same musical motif, with slight variations, is repeated by two girl soloists ~- and the choir: MUSIC: SWORD DANCE: Cut 3 h:15 VOICE: That was the sword-dance by young girls of the Dan tribe. We've talked often about the Mbira, the uniquely African hand-piano, and demonstrated its music many times.

A strip of perforated tin is fastened to the board, and metal rings are passed through hni the holes -- something on the same order as the drum we mentioned a while ago in connection with the boys' dance. When the notes of the mbira are struck, the rings will jingle, of course. Let's have a demonstration of this West African mbira music, as played in the Ivory Coast.

For today's program I've selected some recordings from our Voice of America music libenay, and from time to time weÃ¢Â€Â˜ll call on our VOA Music Man Leo Ssrkisian to share with us some of the fine recordings from his own personal collection. It's Music Time in Africa: UNDER AND OUT: Today, we're going to talk about harps. According to the dictionary the harp is an instrument having many strings, of graded lengths, stretched across an open triangular frame, and played by plucking with the fingers. In Africa, this definition embraces many varietiq of harps. The harps of modern Africa, and those of ancient Egypt have much in common; and this appears to indicate various human migrations that have gone down through the centuries, ever since the time of the Pharoahs. There's an old legend, that when the Kingdom or Buganda defended KKIKKI it self against war from the north, in the 16th century, a god inspired the king to search for a saviour, on an island in Lake Victoria. According to the story, the king round the prophet busily engaged in playing the harp. New whether we can accept this as evidence that the harp came to Buganda then, or had been wellnestablisged already, nobody really knows. Whatever the answer, the harp existed in East Africa for

The five-string/Ã¯Â¬ÂziifoÃ¯Â¬Âzzin as the Adenden, sounds like this: EXAMPLE: Cut 1 0:21 Here is a recording of a group of Teso men in Uganda, playing this ancient harp, and singing an old morality song ~ advising people to live and do their work in keeping with their station in life. ECUDI ODEKAYI ETWANI: 3:50 There's another commonly-known harp in Uganda -Ã¢Â€Â” again a ECUDI Cut 2 horizontal type, and, again, very old. This harp has 8 strings and is called the Tongoli.

Sedikiah Ochwo explains that there is nothing better, and that if one does not work, one just cinnot live. 2:39 In looking for material on ancient harps in our research library, TICH MABERE 0 Cut 3 I ran across some notes, a picture, and some recordings of a harp called the Kundi, belonging to the Azande people of the Congo. The Azande Kundi has five strings, tuned to a five-note scale, and it sounds like this: EXAMPLE: Cut n 0:10 When you listen to Azande harp music, you'll notice that the accompanying songs seen to start very informally Ã¢Â€Â”- the 1118!!! singer or singers, taking their time about getting into the swing of the melody.

If you marry me, I will be your servant, and care for you."" MUGAI ASOLE: Cut 5 ms Music on the Kundi harp of the Azande, in the Congo. In.the Lake Albert country of the northeast Congo, thereÃ¢Â€Â™s still another harp called the Bonguma -- a five-stringed, horizontal arched harp, with e wooden trough for a sound box. Like the Kundi, it's tuned to a fiveÃ¢Â€Â”note scale. But notice the difference in the tone quality: EXAMPLE: Cut 6 0:10 fhe neture or mueicsl expression in the Congo -- and I guess we could say, in all of Centrql kÃ¢Â€Â˜rica Ã¢Â€Â”- is generally vigorous, dynamic and outgoing. Most Central-African singing is of the free; outdoor variety, with everybody taking part at the top of their voices. Phrases are short, and often broken up by frequent breathing. Here's a recording by Sagare Dewu of the Balendy in the Congo. He accompanies himself on the Bonguma harp, end sings about a girl he no longer loves. BONGUMA HARP: Cut 7 2:56 From Central Africa, let's go over to West Africa new and listen to e very old recording of the Djourou harp of the Baoule people, in the Ivory Coast.

She was born in Luanda. the capitol city of Angola, and at an early age began singing and showing promise for a _,lmight musical career. XXIXXXKNK Later on she began to write and compose songs based on the traditional music of her people and the folklore of the country. Her whole artistic career has been dedicated to bringing the music of Angola to the rest of the world.. She performs most of her songs in her native tongue. the KIMBUNDO language, which is known by H relatively few, but her gift of being able to communicate with her voice enables one to feel the passion and love she has for her people and country. Here now is Lilly Tchiumba with a rhythmic dance number titled: Rose's House: She sings that in Rose's house, there were always big parties and that the strong rhythms of the bongo drums which played until dawn would make the mice come out of their holes to dance: ouromm 37 Lilly Tchiumba, in a song about Rose's House where there were always big parties with drum music and dancing until dawn.

Further evidence of NGUNI legacy is I Ã¢Â€Â˜1 ' I ' the Muchongolo dance itself. Actually the NDAU Ã¯Â¬ÂxÃ¯Â¬Â‚Ã¯Â¬ÂhÃ¯Â¬Â call the Ã¢Â€Â˜5. ' . . dance MUCHONGOYO - deriving from the NDAU word ""chongoyo"", I meaning ""stamping one's feet in pain"". But, the elders of Gazaland claim that the dance developed from the NGUNI KIRK! war dance called hhe IHUBO Ã¢Â€Â” also sometimes called the AMAHUBO .mu or the MGUBO. They say that in the old days the IHUBO was performed by batallions or regiments of fighting men on ceremonia occasions. The songs were meant to be sung by a thousand men or (w Ã¢Â€Â˜ more to be really effective, sepecially when they are punctuated by the rhythmic stamping of the bare feet that makes the ground shake withihe pcrcussien. The IHUBO was a slow, stamping dance performed with Ã¯Â¬ÂhKXEKIHEKHKth grandeur by the NGUNI warriors in their military dress. Today's MUCHONGOLO is very different. A shrill whistle or the slow prolonged blowing of a horn signalsÃ¢Â€Â˜ gÃ¢Â€Âœ; the beginning of the dance. This is followed by an explosive cry of voices and a burst of drumming. Suddenly the random whistling, the shouting and singing join under one'fhythmic pattern held an by the drums or just plain handclapping: MUSIC: CUT ONE: 3:45 r VOICE: And that was our first example of the music accompanying the L g?

And at times, girls who were betrothed to the young warriors, would also carry spears and shields and join in the singing and dancing. The dancers must execute apparently spontaneous movements with perfect unity. The greater the element of surprise and spdntaneity, the more the acclaim given xxx to the dancers. In the old days, the iggÃ¯Â¬Âgxxmxn was also performed by large hunting parties on the return from a successful hunt - especially on the occasion of killing a lion or a leopard. The dance would take place in inmmÃ¯Â¬ÂmnÃ¯Â¬ÂxmhnxnkmnÃ¯Â¬Â‚ the presence of the tribal chief who would reward the hunters for their success.

I think the group should be commended for the excellent arrangements and adaptation of folk songs into fresh danceable tunes with a nice easg swing. Their versatility is evident, not only in the music, but also in the vocals. In this next number they sing in the language of anothpr',Ã‚Â»hi and the song title is: % people in Malawi - the Lomwe:/""ECHIPINI"":(etch-i-pini) MÃ¯Â¬Â‚Ã¯Â¬ÂlÃ¯Â¬Â: CUT TWO: 2:52 VOECE: ""Echipini yakaya mora"", sung in the Lomwe language, thxmxxg KHEMHZECXBKMHTÃ¯Â¬ÂtmeÃ¯Â¬ÂeEEKMEMEHEKÃ¯Â¬ÂMÃ¯Â¬ÂuKMXMIHXMXEKH The members of o? the MBC Band, in this medley of two numbers from their KOKOLIKO album, demonstrate the group's qualifications as a super band see ' with super musicianship.

It is unite evident, I think, afterrlistening to these recordings, that: each member of the ensemble is quite concerned with the end' product of his or herx musical efforts. By expressing themselves in song and music they wish to communicate with people, and I think they accomplish this quite capably. The QUEENS take the lead in this CHI-CHEHÃ¢Â€Â”WA number titled:""MwANA WA mzako(mwana-wahm-zahko) 1x.Ã¢Â€Âœ 3: 1:711"" 1:01:11: 2:51 Wi' Mwana wa MZAKO"", a CHICHEwA song by the CHICHIRI QUEENS.

MUSIC TIME IN AFRICA MAY 9, 1976 I page 2 date. The Turareg belong to the Muslim faith and traditionally give IÃ¢Â€Âœ i the impression of being a civilization which is withdrawn into itself and where the woman holds pride of place. As a matter of fact tttles of nobility and certain rights of ownership are handed down through the maternal line, and though it may be exaggerated to speak of a matriarchy, the influence of women in the Tuareg society should not beLinderÃ¢Â€Â”estimated. The women are more firmly attached to the traditions of nomad life and offer the strongest resistance to any inclination toward changes. The woman, therefore, is virtually worshipped. The TUAREB dedicate -Ã¢Â€Âœ their most beautiful poems and songs to her charms, and her virtues. There are no professional TUAREG musicians in the proper sense of the wordÃ¯Â¬Âand music is performed by both men and women, but they specialize in quite different types. The type of music most frequently practiced by the women is called TINDE - from the name of the drum most often used. lhe drum is generally IXMK an ordinary mortar covered with a tanned goatskin attached by cords in which are fixed two long hhÃ¯Â¬ÂhÃ¯Â¬ÂlÃ¯Â¬Âl parallel sticks. At each side of the drum a woman sits on the projecting ends of the s inks t keep the tension of the membrane even.

There are actually two types of TINDE singing Ã¢Â€Â” one T composed exclusively of songs of praise - called TINDE-NOMNAS, the other, TINDE N'GOUMA, consists of songs of exorcism. Tuareg

The male vocalist, singing xxmng alone or else with the simple accompaniment of a one-stringed violin, gives free rein to the emotion which inspires him, whether it is aroused by the woman

Although there are many songs performed by a male vocalist without accompaniment, it frequently happens that the singer is accompanied by a woman playing a oneustringed fiddle - the INZAD - a large gourd, dried and emptied, and covered with goetskin.

I'm Sue Moran, welcoming you back for our weekly music show featuring some of Africa's finest musicians and cultural groups, of yesterday, today and tomorrow. The music I've selected for today are the traditional songs and dances from the high mountains and desert regions of histor'c Ethiopia - a unique country in Africa that is the source of the Nile. The recordings will give some IEHKXEXKXKK idea of the immense variety of Ethiopian music, so stay with me now for Music Time in Africa: THEME: 10 SECS, UNDER AND OUT: VOICE: Historic Ethiopia consists of the high plateau of the north, home of the farmers speaking the demitic languages of Amharie, Tigrinya and Tigre(ti~greh). Those derive from an old Ethiopic literary language still used in both the Christian and Judaic liturgy. EhhiOpian Christianity is deeplyÃ¢Â€Â”rooted and meticulously obserVed in the whole of the plateau - except for isolated groups of FALASHAS, a Judaic sect. Successxive Moslem invasions have peopled the south and the east with CushiticÃ¢Â€Â”speaking GALLA pastoralists. Even the DANAKIL, mining rockÃ¢Â€Â”salt in the deserts near the Red Sea, are nominally Moslem. Along the western border is another group: tall, darkÃ¢Â€Â”skhnned Sudanic people living near the BARO River. Dozens of small farming tribes of the South-w633 also speak Cushitic languages, usually incomprehensible to their neighbors a few kilometers away. As I mentioned before, the recordings I have here will give you an idea of the great variety of music styles-found in Ethiopia. the 6000 ADARES(Adar-eh's)

Unlike the other Ethiopian Semitic-speakers, however, the ADARES are neither Christians nor Jews, but are strict Moslems. Their language, their costumes, and some of their regligious obseriances are distinctive, but their music is most distinctive of all, for nowhere else in Ethiopia is this type of indigenous polyphony, that is, the singing of several melodies together, to be found. Two young ADAREH (ada-reh) girls sing ghhhÃ¯Â¬ÂhÃ¯Â¬Â‚hÃ¯Â¬Â‚gÃ¯Â¬ÂÃ¯Â¬Â love song in the distinctive old-style typical of this region: CUT ONE: 2:20 An old-style love song of the ADARES who live in the eastern region of EthiOpia. The MBIRA hand-piano found throughout most of sub-Sahara Africa is a well-known instrument among the Sudanese peoples living in the extrema west of the conntry.- Among the ANUAK and the NUER it is called TOUM Ã¢Â€Â” a small wooden box with metal keys that are plucked with both thumbs. Often one hears the term ""thumb-piano"" in describing the instrument. In Ethiopia, this charming instrument is used almost entirely for love songs, for which its delicate tone is eminently syitable. In this recording, a youth of the ANUAK tribe from the village of GAMBELA, plays the ""toum"" in accompaniment to a love song: CUT TWO: 2:1h Probably the most famous and popular folk song in Ethiopian music is AMBASSEL - a tune belonging to the great classic tradition of My MgÃ¯Â¬ÂÃ¯Â¬Â‚mgggmÃ¯Â¬ÂmxmÃ¯Â¬ÂmxnÃ¯Â¬Ânghhhhx ""wax-and-gold"" music and poetry. In this type of music, the love of a place, in this case ""AMBASSEL"" is the wax, butthe double-meaning words, which concern the love of a woman, are the hidden meaning, or the gold. The vocalist in

From the Lake SHAMO region in southern Ethiopia, here now is music of the GIDOLE people. The GIDOLE are a small Cushitic-spcaking tribe farming in the inaccessible mountains bordering Lake Shame. The music is performed by a flute ensemble composed of la bamboo flutes, - each flute, graduated in size, Ã¯Â¬Â‚"" giving only one note. The fourteen players dance in a circle, each sounding his note at a given moment, so that an intricate mosaic is produced: CUT FOUR: 3138M 2:20 That was dance music of the GIDOLE people in southern Ethiopia fourteen-man flute ensemble. The GIDOLE, in common with several other SouthÃ¢Â€Â”West UushiticÃ¢Â€Â”speaking tribes, employ an interruptedÃ¢Â€Â”breath technique when singing. This gives a tremendous vitality and dynamic feeling to their music. SHILOTA, the title of this next number, is a men's dance, accompanied by handclappimgz 3:30 The DANAKIL people who live in the eastern part of Ethiopia speak CUT FIVE: the language called AFAR - hmmmmhmmamtmzmnmxmmmthsmmmrMhmrmxmsgimn xmikxhhmmmamxmxmÃ¯Â¬ÂÃ¯Â¬ÂÃ¯Â¬ÂÃ¯Â¬Â but those libing in the southern area of DANAKIL country called themselves ADAL. ihe music of the ADAL which I've selected is hÃ¯Â¬ÂhÃ¯Â¬ÂÃ¯Â¬Â‚hÃ¯Â¬ÂxzÃ¯Â¬Âi ceremonial music - an entire age-group is circumcised at the same time, and the ceremony is an important one for the tribe as well as for the individualo

The KUNAMA are a Cushitic- speaking group in the extreme northÃ¢Â€Â”west of Ethiopia. Like the ADARES of the south-east, they differ in language, in religion, is in customs, and especially in music from all their neighbors. 'V.Their music, accompanied by the drum which it is the duty of the wife to play so that the husband may dance, bears more resemblance to East African music than to that of northern Ethiopia. Here the dancers are wearing plaited palm-leaf anklets which rattle in the great vigorous leaps of the dance: MUSIC: CUT SEVEN: h:17 VOICE: You've been listening to the traditional songs and dance music of some of the various peoples in Ethiopia.

Music TIME IN AFRICA The following program is Music Time in octcber 12, 1975: ' 15 secs PAUSE: . 0;; Africa for breadcast on 5unday amÃ‚Â» It's Mudic Time in Africa: Ã¢Â€Â˜ THEM"": 15 SECS, UNDER AND OUT: Hello there, I'm Sue Moran, and this is our weekly music show featuring some of Africa's finest musicians and cultural groups performing both traditional and popular African music. I'm so glad you're Joining me today, friends. This will be the second part of two special programs on the music of the JOS Plateau region in the Federal Republic of Nigeria. Last week I hadÃ¢Â€Â™ recordings of the BIRCH, ANGASÃ¯Â¬Â JARAWA and PYEM people who live in the Plateau region and today it'll be music of the YERGAM and BURUM who also inhabit the same area in central Nigeria.l So stay with me now for Music Time in,ifrica: 10 SECS, UNDER AND OUT: I'd like to KEEIKX First, before I begin with today=s recordings, simply recall that the J03 Plateau, where the recordings were made _is mn the center of Nigeria and rises to an average height of 1290 meters. It makes up the ncrthern extreme of BENÃ¯Â¬ÂÃ¯Â¬Â-PLATEAU state, one of the 12 states of the Federal Republic of Nigeria. There are about no or so tribes and sub-tribes of various origins, each possessing its own language and traditions. Known history of / r the YERGAM and BURUM dates back to the 13th and luth centuries but it was during the 16th and 17th centuries that they were part of the famous JUKUN Empire. I'm starting off today's program with traditional music of the Yergam from the village of ZUNGZUHG. The YERGAM tell the story of a man who disappears from the village. .n .

Some time later, he returns and 'begins to sing, obviously inspired. This new power, called KbMTIN, cones from aquatic spirits in whom they perceive the real creators of the music. The KbMTIN style of music is essentially choral and polyphonic. In this recording a dozen men and women divide themselves into several sections between which the vocal parts are distributed. A male sclist improvises variations and after a change of rhythm a new melody appears, stated in unison, but soon i superimposed with a variation sung by the women. Ã¢Â€Â˜he members of the group play various percussion instruments - half-calabashes called IKPANG-IdHIR, and grain-filled calabash rattles known as AKISHAK: CUT ONE: IKERK 3:55 hÃ‚Â¥ Like most of the other tribes on the JOS Plateau, the YERGAM uses the MOLD raft zither frquently in their music. Made entirely from reed, the instruments usually have five groups of three strings. The ensemble in this next recording consists of two MOLD zithers, a bow-harp, a bottle hit with a metal rod, and a dry vegetable pod used as a rattle. The singer and leader of the group plays one of the raft zithers. The idea of getting together a nnxs MOLO orchestra is an inovation, the instrument being traditionally used alone by one or several singers. the orchestra in this number is certainly a result of a new situation where some musicians are becoming more professional, and where their audience is no longer limited to a single village: CUT Two: W 14.:30 Music of the YERGAM by a MOLO raft-zither orchestra recorded in the village of LANGRANG. StillÃ¯Â¬Âbiggsr than the orchestra you just heard, this following selection is played by an ensemble of four tiÃ‚Â»

A total of eight ~ but here, it's a family affair, the orchestra being made up of brothers and wives of the !, lead singer. One of the wives_p1ays the harp, an instrument WW normally reserved for men. In this song, ZHIMAK TYEM congratulates the people present, including a district official whom he asks to In?Ã¢Â€Âœ serve the ppople well; begs the visitors to take greetings to JOS; introduces his wives and encourages them to play loudly and with feeling, so that he will earn enough to feed them: CUT THREE: 2:1;0 The BURUM, present neighbors of the YERGAM, say they originated from the JUKUN, of which they would have been a branch or vassal tribe. Like the renew, the BURUM were also a part of Ã¢Â€Â˜the JUKUN tsÃ¢Â€Â˜ Empire during the 16th and 17th centuries, and share the same type' of existence as the other Plateau peoples - an essentially ts agricultural economy with a few handicrafts - pottery, basketÃ¢Â€Â” weaving, and forging. Their music style is very marked by IIIEÃƒÂ©} making, the HAUSA influence, as much by the melody and rhythm as by the E,Ã¢Â€Âœ instruments themselves. I have two Very good examples of BURUM a music here - the first is a number called WASAM BURUM, meaning Ã¢Â€ÂœÃ¯Â¬Ât the BURUM play, has an entertainment dance for evaryone. One QM musician hits a shoulderÃ¢Â€Â”slung drum with his open hand, and another' on the ground with a curved drum-stick. A third drum is played by.Ã¢Â€Â˜ another musician. Coming in different sizes, these cylindrical drums are all called GANGA - a HAUSA term: CUT FOUR: 3:08 This second example of BURUM music is, like the recording you Just Its title - KIDA MANOMA Ã¢Â€Â” means heard, an entertainment dance. n.7,... .s;

I've chosen as my final selection today another #5 recording of YERGAM music - an excellent example of dance music .-.e performed by a whistle-flute ensemble for a harvest celebration. Ã¢Â€Âœ7 this type of music in the YERGAM language is called IZUR NFIKO - Lg] IZUR meaning whistle flute and NFIKO meaning ""harvest"". An ensemble generally comprises a dozen whistle flutes made from reeds of MÃ¢Â€Âœ different lenght Ã¢Â€Â” between about ten and thirty centimeters - Ã¢Â€Â˜ ""m pg without lateral holes and held vertically between the thumb and rÃ¢Â€Âœ index finger. The IZUR are carefully tuned with each other, each $3 giving a sound corresponding to its lenght. The musicians come in R $3 in the ensemble in rapid succession and in a precise order. Besides whistle-flutes in this recording, the group also includes a large ga barrgll drum hit with a curved drum stick, a metallic gong in V fÃ¢Â€Âœ form hit with an iron rod, and a rattle made from a half-calabash: .vÃ¢Â€Â™Ã¢Â€Â MUSIC, CUT SIX: 5:00 VOICE: Music from the JCS Plateau Region in Nigeria and it's time to go OI friends.

Along the great bend of the NIGER River, where it touches the edge of the Sahara desert, KKKHXI live the SONGHAI, one of the large number of ethnic groups that make up Mali's varied population. The SONGHAI first appeared in history when ruled by an ancient Berber dynasty driven south by Arab conquest. In the year 1009, the city of GAO on the-Niger became the capital and administrative center for the Songhai, and also at about this time began their conversion to Islam. Written history about the SONGHAI appears in manuscripts by two historians living in TIMBUCTU during the 17th century. IMXHMHXMKMEX In their songs are the tales and

Even today we can-still hear abOut these ancient legends in the verses sung by Songhai musicians. This first recording of Songhai music takes us back to the time of the ruling PASHAS of TIMBUKTU. The song is about the OULAD HXSSAN, a family of aristocrats who have their descendants at TIMBUKTU still today: M 3:05 The name of that song was TANDINA, about an aristocratic Songhai CUT ONE: family that lived in TIMBUKTU several hundred years ago and today (a ' there are still descendants of IE2; family in that town.

In the course of the singing, more and more verses are improvised by the guests: 3zu5 The musical instrument that dominates the music of the Songhai isÃ¢Â€Âœ CUT TWO: the African lute. It has three main strings, although sometimes four, and is similar to the TIDINIT of the Moorish griots in Mauretainia, the KONNI(koh-nee) of the Mandingo, the HALAM(hah-lahm) of the Wolof, and the same as the lutes found among other peoples of West Africa. It's a wooden sound-box with a skin stretched over it. The neck of the instrument is a wooden stick fixed into the sound-box under the skin, and the strings are stetched over a bridge up to the tip of the wooden pole. The most characteristic thing about the instrument is the method of playing it -Ã‚Â« the musician simultaneously taps the stretched skin of the sound-box

Just like the M core of Mauretania, the Songhai reserve the playing of the lite for men only. A good example of Songhai virtuosity in lute playing is this dance song recorded in the village of ANSONGO, about 65 miles, or 100 kilometers south of the city of GAO on the N iger. It demonstrates not only the excellent finger technique IÃ‚Â» that can be attained on the lute but also the technique of tapping the sound-box for rhythmic accompaniment.

Ceremonial musicians are in great demand for various ritual occasions, and they always play in troupes. Our (a musical visit in the Malagasy Republic begins on the East Coast - probably the most scenic part of the country, and where there is an abundance of coffee. Here the folk songs reflect the daily work of the coffee growers, the raising and the harvesting, the sorting and the husking and the dancing after the work is finished. In this first recording, we have a medley of songs accompanying all the activities of coffee production in the east region of the island: CUT ONE: hzho Malagasy music from the east coast of the island ~ it was a medley of songs for coffee-raising, for the harvesting and sorting, and the husking of the coffee beans in the mortars, and finally the music for the end of the day's work and dancing.

This next selection begins with a song about the fishermen going out to sea in their boats which uptil today still resemble the craft of their distant ancestors. The music continues with the

With the help of our Voice of America musiciman, Leo Sarkisian, I've chosen a number of recordings of the traditional music of the TONGA, an important people who liVed along the ZAMBEZI river, both in ZAMBIA and RHODESIA I'm sure you'llenjoy the program, so jtin me now for Music Time in Africa: 10 SECS, bNDER AND OUT: The region along the famous ZAMBEZI river, of which the northern part lies in Zambia, and the southern part in Rhodesia, has aaaargnne undergone great changes in the past tWenty years,Ã¢Â€Â”ehanges which have also had tremendous effects on the lives of the TONGA who were the principal inhabitants ofthat regionu People were Ã¯Â¬ÂaÃ¯Â¬ÂhÃ¯Â¬ÂÃ¯Â¬Âh uprobted and removed from ancestral villages and homes and resettled in new areas ~ social life and customs had to be adjusted to new cpnditionsÃ‚Â° Fortunately, before the actual changes took place, individuals with great foresight established research projects to study,xnx record and document the traditional history and customs of the Ã¯Â¬ÂnÃ¯Â¬ÂÃ¯Â¬ÂxÃ¯Â¬Â region and the people in it, as much and as quick as possible.

Pairs of dancers, girl and boy, came out and danced a rather stiff dahce together and then returned to the crowd as another pair teak their place. While the circle of young folk clap their hands, thew sing: MA~CHBWEREWERE(mah-cheeÃ¢Â€Â”wehÃ¢Â€Â”reh~weh-reh), which means ""pulling"" and refers to the pullingein of the dancers, or pulling each other into the ring as they dance inside the circle of aingers."" MUSIC: CUT ONE: was, VOICE: Mankuntu dance music of the Tonga in Zambia, recorded during a performance of the dance by a large group of young men and women.

The musician strikes the cord with a reed stick and changes the 1m: tone of theinstrument by pressing the lower section of the string with hhe tip of his left thumb. The Kalumbo bow in this recording is played by Blakufus Simqulo, who sings:""Never mention me to your husband, I cannot marry a.Luvale girl, or a Shona, because they put on ties.

In the country of Botswana. the rswana were always great cattle raiser: ani hunters ~ therefuie, many of their old traditional folk songs ard dances were about hunting and their cattle. This first recording an our program today viÃ‚Â» actually made, some years ago, during the occasion of preSJnting a lion skin to a chief. A Tswana hunting party, having just retrrned from killing a lion that had been terroriziig a cattle p)st, w.s marching proudly up through the village to the chief's council place, to offer the trophy - the lion's 1kino L

As they marched they sang this song: CUT ONL: 2:u] I That was 1 song for the presentation of a lion skin 50 the chief, the afielmath of a lionÃ¢Â€Â”hunt that took place some zears ago in Botswana.

The pipes are called DITLHAKA and the pitch of each pipe can be varied by the player both by position of the lips and tongue over the mouthpiece and also by the force of the wind, especially noticeable in the higher pitched pipes. Tuning varies from performance to performance Ã¢Â€Â” the pitch of each pipe being adjustrd by means of a plug. The performers walk round sideways in a circle, lsing a simple stamping stop or shuffle or leaping in the air in en anti-clockwise direction.

It's played by sitting on the ground with the right leg paSScd through the bow. The curved wooden part of the bow rests on the grOund, with the string uppermost, and the left hand steadies it while the right NXKH one planks the string. The bow-harp is played by both men and women, and 13 you should ask any of the players when thoy like to playÃ¢Â€Â˜especialff, theuanswer will probably be --""Oh, any time when we feel lonely"": 2:55 As I mentioned earlier, folksongs in Botswana are closely CUTFZVE: connected with daily activities like hunting, herding cattle, and then +here's the pounding and threshing, carrying loads, riding, and hmuÃ¯Â¬ÂngxMhmxgamÃ¯Â¬Â‚nnm working in the garden.

ItÃ¢Â€Â˜s an old recording selected for you but an exchhlent example of KARANGA singing style n the song accompanies the Gawo dance with the typical yodeling of the women in the background: Ã¢Â€Â˜MUSICr CUTONE 2:10 VOICE: Music for the GAWO dance of the Shona in southern Rhodesia. Although Q the music was performed by the KARANGA,it was sung in the Mari dialect of the CHIBI district. This next recording is also by the KARANGA and from the same region but sing in the DUMA dialect. It's a medley of two songs by a group of KARANGA women: V 3:30 That was music of the KARANGA, part of the SHONA group of peoples Zezeru EEEBE-and live CUT TWO: 1 in sonthern Rhodesia.

But I think an interesting point is, that, in the ancient ruins of ZIMBABWE parts of an ancient type of MBIRA ssexx WEE were found. This type is probably the MBIRA / DZA VADZIMU, the oldest known form of MBIRA to be played by the SHOHA of southern Rhodesia.

MANYIKA songs have their own disctinctive style as you will notice in this next recording.

The art of music, first of all, beganÃ¢Â€Â˜its development at that time in history'when only musical folklore its existed Ã¢Â€Â” primarily a period of unwritten traditional development of musical art in which the folksong was the leading forma Later, with th beginning of'early civilizations and urban life, and with th emergence of written literary languages, the art of music developed along three_closely-connected lines: _

,u oÃ¢Â€Â˜ : V page 2 1 . folkmusic, professional unwritten traditional music and the ,z/Ã¢Â€Â™ ,r 4 3 /Ã¢Â€Â Ã¢Â€ÂÃ¢Â€Âœ science of music. Folkmusic gave birth to all the forms of profueosional{traditional musical art and also produced the peculiar style of urban folkmusic and songs, and continued to express the attitudes of both urban and rural peoples toward the events of social life. In professional unnritten traditional music there appeared new and richer forms of vocal,anstrumental a} and vocalninstrumental music, -- and then, as a result of extensive devologhcnt in Lusical art, the science of music was founded in its two broad aspects: history of music and the theory of music. Creative activity among the various Ã¯Â¬ÂÃ‚Â§Ã‚Â§XEK peOples in the world worked out modern musical notation, forms of harmong and polyphony, scales and tonal systems. Still, it has been i} musical folklore that has played the determining role at every phase of emergence and progress of music right up into our time/pÃ‚Â§ ., today. However complex and developed all the forms of modern maxi ;: music may be, they are based on those of folkmusic. It becomes /. especially significant during periods when national musical cultures are being fermed, influencing the development of 43 characteristic national features in the music of the nations of m our time. I've made this brief reference to the important role of musical folklore in the history of music as a means of introducing the music I have for you on today's program. As I {i mentioned earlier, the songs you'll be hearing are performed by the Black Orpheus Folk Singers of $0uth Africa. The recordings were prepared and sent to us by the group and its director, James Kumalo; who also is a lecturer in Bantu languages at the University of Witwatersrand in Johannesburg. James Kumalo and/xv 4 his group have captured the poetical beauty of the folksongs of southern AfricaÃ¯Â¬Â-bringing to life the musical traditions of their

Trained singers, dres are and trumpeters formed groups that played at the chief's official appearances, accompanied him on journeys, and Ã¯Â¬ÂhÃ¯Â¬ÂhhiIKXMIÃ¯Â¬ÂEgÃ¯Â¬Âe "" in general, increased his prestige. Ã¯Â¬Âfth A few descendants of the old chiefs still retain such groups today. It used to be that these musicians played only in honor of the chief-me but now they take part in all kinds of festivities, and our first number today is performed by just such a group. It consists of ten singers. One soloist alternates with a second, who breaks in with loud interruptions. The other eight, forming a chorus, keep repeating the same motiÃ¯Â¬Â. A rattle made from a calabash, and two chains of brass rings, accompany the singhg: CUT ONE: 7): That was music for a chief, by singers of the DAN tribe in the western part of the IVORY COAST. Practically everything that goes on in community life of the DAN provides occasion for dancing. Apart from the great final ceremonies, that is, the burial and funeral rites, the most important events are the ceremonies that mark the transition from childhood to full adult status in the I drummers community. Here now are three/playing at a large-comingnogmage festiVal, providing the exciting rhythm for the dances of a group of young men. The chief drummer plays a large drum to which he. has attached four smaller drums Ã¢Â€Â” each with a different iÃ¯Â¬ÂhÃ¯Â¬ÂÃ¯Â¬Â‚ tone - thus enabling him to play his embellished rhythms at various levels of pitch. It's actually the tone contrasts-of these various~ size drums that and the eleitement to the danced in this recording the chief drummer begins alone, to be joined after a few measures "" ' Ã¢Â€Â˜ 1 H n L. 1 mrÃ¢Â€Â™ '..~ :3 . 9v by the other two.

Among the DAN there's also a traditional sword dance done by young girls for their coming-of-age festival. The girls enter the open meeting-place in the center of the village, holding up swords as they dance to the rhythmic beats of thee hour-glassushaoed,pressureÃ¢Â€Â”tyte drums. xsexgxrxx Traditionally, the dance belonged to the Malinke tribe. CUT THREE: 7,5Ã¢Â€Â ' We've often talked about the MBIRA ~ the uniquely African handÃ¢Â€Â” piano, and demonstrated its music manytimes. The DAN Ã¯Â¬Âhhgl in the Ivory Coast have the MBIRA also ~ known as the KOTA. A row of metal strips are attached to a board, with a calabash resonator fitted underneath to amplify the sound of the plucking of the metal strips. A piece of perforated tin is fastened to the board, and metal rings are passed through the holes Ã¢Â€Â”Ã¢Â€Â” something like the drum we mentioned awhile ago in connection with the boy's dance. When the notes of the KOTA are struck, the rings will jingle, of course. Let's have a demonstration of this west African MBIRA new, -- the KOTA of Ivory Coast. CUT Foes: / J In the village of BOLA, in the heart of DAN country, it's in the very early evening, Just at twilight, and twenty or so small gxrrs girls, ranging in age from about five to eight, have gathered \,

One lsoloist begins, and is answered by the chorus, and then the 13Ã¢Â€Â˜; second sings and is answered, and so on: g MUSIC: CUT FIVE: 2:02 I Ã¢Â€Â˜ VOICE: In the Ivory Coast during the dry season, mask races are often held among the DAN on market days. The best runners compete -~ someÃ¯Â¬Âwearing masks, and some not. The man wearing the mask pursues J ; a yÃƒÂ©ung man who tries to escape by dodging between-the huts. If :3 theÃ‚Â§runner gets away, an of course, he becomes the winner. But, Ã¢Â€Â™ i if the masked man catches him, it's the masked man who wins. Several pairs compete one after the other, and the race is accompanied by music like this: Ã¢Â€Â˜MUSIC: CUT SIX: 1:55 VOICE: Music for a traditional mask race by nusicians of the DAN xax in I; the Ivory Coast.Ã¢Â€Â˜ The DAN, like most peoples in Africa, have the traditton of special music during the harvest season. When this recording was made, two drummers were among the workers, giving_l the steady rhythm that kept the work moving. The singing is done by the Ã¯Â¬ÂÃ¯Â¬ÂhÃ¯Â¬ÂhÃ¯Â¬ÂÃ¯Â¬Â reapers, encouraging one another. ÃƒÂ©hey cut the grain in time to the rhythm, and when they have gathered a sheaf r togehher, boys and girls come and tans it asay to add to the idÃ¯Â¬Â‚ÃƒÂ©d stack already cut. The foreman of the reapers wears metal balls on Ã¢Â€Âœ3 Ã¢Â€Â˜ his ankles which jingle as he dances. And if you listen hard, you I may hear the rustling sound made by the rise stalks, as the harvesters Work their way through the rows: 7Ã¢Â€Â˜ auslc- CUT SEVEN: 1:u7

{J i {j t) {3 ..V _Ã¢Â€Â”v Q voICE: That was music for the harvest season in the tradition of the DAN people in western Ivory Coast. I mentioned at the beginning of this 5 program that Leo Sarkisian, our musicman and nnsicologist in residence, worked among the GIO who live in the same region KXhEÃ¯Â¬ÂI on the Liberian side of the border.

As most of you who have been listening each week know, usually we're featuring the music of a certain country or talking about certain types of music, tradittonal dances and songs and musical instruments. Our program today pays tribute to an African composer and musician whose works have had a deep influence on the modern music of West Africa today. 30, friends, stay tuned in for the next half hour for some of West Africa's finest modern music played by the National BEMBEYA JAZZ orchestra of Guinea on MUSIC TIME IN AFRICA: 10 SECS: UNDER AND OUT: ABOUBAKAR DEMBA CAMARA is a name that will live long in the'history of West African music, among the names of the ancient GRIOTS and 2 among those Ã¯Â¬ÂKK artistts and musicians performing today. His music will also influence those who are to perform African music in the future just as it has influenced those active in today's music in West Africa. ABOUBAKAR, born in Conakry, the capital of the Republic of Guinea, was a prolific composer, arranger, musician and poet who died in April 1973 at the age of 29. It was his music and voice that made the BEMBEYA JAZZ orchestra famous throughout West Africa. His arrangements of traditional Malinke music became the hottest hit recordings by the Bembeya Group.

WARA meaning panther and recording WARABA meaning tiger. Probably one of the reasons why this/unÃ¯Â¬Ât]: the hlxlml did become a popular hit was that ABOUBAKAR sings in/x pure traditional style of the ancient ""griot"" minstrels: MUSIC: GUT 2 ÃƒÂ©yigÃ¯Â¬Â The young composer and arranger Aboubakar Demba Camara showed Ii! his genius and skill IÃ¯Â¬ÂXIÃ¯Â¬ÂXKÃ¯Â¬ÂEIÃ¯Â¬ÂEXÃ¯Â¬ÂiIIK by taking some of the most difficult songs from among the old classics usually performed by the expert KORA harp players and xylophone virtuosos, and arranged the music for modern orchestra and in tempos suitable for dancing yet retaining the traditional flavor andmxmngimgmxmymn of the original piece and pnxÃ¯Â¬Â‚lnmmagxmxminm A good example is this recording by ABOUBAKAR and the BEMBEYA JAZZ of singing style; BENI BARA-LEH, a popular old classic known and performed by musicians and griots throughout most of West Africa: CUT 3 3zu5 Ã¯Â¬Â‚

Some of the harps haven't changed XKEEK their ancient forms, either. According to the dictionary, the harp is an instrument having many strings, of graded lengths, strethhed across an open triangular frame, and played by plucking with the fingers. In Africa, this definition embraces many varieties of harps. There's an interesting old legend that when the Kingdom of Buganda defended itselg against war from the north, in the 16th century, a god inspired the King to search for a saviour, on an island in Lake Victoria. According to the story, the King found the prophet busily engaged in playing the harp. Now whether we can accept this as evidence that the harp came to Buganda then, or had been well established already, nobody really knows. WhateVer the answer, the harp existed in East Africa for at least 3 or u centuries. For cmmparison of sounds, here's' the ancient 5 string KUNDI of the AZANDE in Zaire: CUT 1 0:10 And the five-string ADENDEN in Uganda: CUT 2 l0:21~ J The harpof the Somali: g CUT 3 i 0:10 Then there's the ancient KRAR of Ethiopia: CUT a 0:25 Here's the 8-string LITUNGU in Kenya: CUT 5 0:12 1w"" xÃ‚Â»? has as Liv}

They all belong to the same linguistic family, but few of their languages are closely related as English ,2 and FrenchÃ‚Â° The impenetrable nature of the country - rugged mountains, rivers, impassable after rains, np roads or other communications - M have combined with these difficulties to preserve the individual .e character of each tribe. Their music, like other aspects of their % culture, has tended to remain distinctiveo These CushiticÃ¢Â€Â”speaking lg tribes have certain cultural similarities. Their social organization Ã‚Â§ is based on an ageÃ¢Â€Â”g-ade system, and much of their music has developtg from ceremonies where one agoÃ¢Â€Â”grade yaesee to another, Their Economic basis of life is also similar, for they are all primarily farmerso

Work songs thanking are therefore common among all these tribes. Hoeing songs, pounding songs, threshing songs and even songs to encourage the farmers to work harder. I going to begin our show now with a coffee-grinding song by a group of Darassa tribesmen in Sidamo Province. CUT ONE: 3:15 The music of these Cushitic peoples shows other similaritieso In all of these tribes, every man can sing his personal history song - what he has done in life, what his father has done, all the notewothhy happenings in the family and the song may go back to the migration of the tribe, and the legendary founding of the clan. These songs sound like this example by a man of the Sidamo tribe, who interrupts the verses of his song with humming and breathing: 0:35 - of this personal history song type is this CUT Two: Another example recording of an eighty-two year old man of the KAFFA people in Kaffa Province: 1 O: CUT THREE: 30 Music for dancing, accompanied by drums, occurs throughout the 1? area.

THE MUSIC IS FOR THE PERFORMANCE OF AN OLD FOLK DANCE KNOWN AS THE MUGANDA. THE Ã¢Â€Â˜DANCERS FORM IN GROUPS OR TEAMS TO COMPETE WITH EACH OTHER; EACH Ã¢Â€Â˜ DANCER SINGS THROUGH A COURD WHICH IS CALLED THE MALIPENGA SINGING HORN. THE DANCE TEAMS CHALLENGE ONE ANOTHER IN SONG AND BOAST ABOUT THEIR PERFORMANCES: EHSIENEM MUSIC: CUT ONE: 3:10 ,HNEEE VOICE: MUSIC FOR THE MUGANDA DANCE OF THE CHEWA PEOPLE IN MALAWI. THIS NEXT RECORDING IS A VERY INTERESTING ONE. IT WAS MADE IN 1958, TWENTY-ONE YEARS AGO, IN THE VILLAGE OF CHIEF MWASI, THE MUSIC IS FOR THE NYAU DANCE WHICH WAS PERFORMED IN THOSI DAYS ONLY DURING THE DRY SEASON. THE DANCERS PUT ON RACE AND Ã¢Â€ÂœÃ¢Â€Â˜COVERED THEIR RACES AND HEADS WITH HEATHERS OR GRASS MASKS SO VTHAT THEY WOULD NOT BE RECQHGNIZED. IT IS AN INITIATION DANCE FOR BOYS BUT IN SOME CASES, WOMEN INSTRUCTORS OR THE VILLAGE WOULD USE THE OCCASION AS AN EXCUSE To CATCH NIEHEEEIENEE DISOEEDIENT GIRLS AND BEAT THEM. IT ALWAYS APPEARED To BE THE GIRLS WHO NEEDED INSTRUCTION AND NEVER THE BOYS WHO MERELI WENT THROUGH THEIR INITIATION CEREMCNIES: I MUSIC: CUT Two: 2:51 V VOICE: A GROUP OE CHEWA WOMEN AND GIRLS OF KASUNGU IN MALAWI SING TWO VERSES WITH HANDCLAPPING ACCOMPANIMENT IN THIS NEXT SELECTION. IN THE FIRST VERSE THEY SAY:"" WHEN YOU ARE ALONE DO NOT QUARREL WITH ANYONE, BECAUSE THESE VERY FRIENDS OF YOURS MAY HAVE SOMETHING GOOD ABOUT THEM. THEY MAY GO AND CATCH A FOWL AND GIVE IT To YOU"". WELL, I THINK THAT'S GOOD SOUND ADVICE, DON'T YOU? THE SECOND VERSE EN ALSO SEEMS To BE GOOD AUENQE - IT GOES SOMETHING LIKE THIS:"" LET US SETTLE HERE PROPERLY, MY NEPHEW, THE COUNTRY DOES Ã¢Â€Â™, {Ã¢Â€ÂœWÃ¢Â€Â™?

MUSIC TIME IN AFRICA daÃ¢Â€Â” 1 JUNE 18, 1978 PAGE TWO VOICE: I MUSTE CONFESS, LEO, THAT I HAD NO IDEA THAT THERE WERE SO MANY DIFFERENT LEO: MUSIC: VOICEI LEO - TYPES OF XYLOPHONES AND HOW THE INSTRUMENT IS SO WIDELY SPREAD THROUGHOUT I SUBÃ¢Â€Â”SAHARA AFRICA UNTIL I HEARD SOME OF THE RECORDINGS IN YOUR COLLECTION: WELL, FROM EAST AND SOUTHERN AFRICA, UP THROUGH CENTRAL AFRICA AND ACROSS THE CONTINENT THROUGH WEST AFRICA, THE TYPES OF XYLOPHONES ARE COUNTLESS - VARYING IN SIZE AND SHAPE - FROM SHELL INSTRUMENTS WITH TWO, THREE OR FOUR NOTES, UP TO HUGE GIANT-SIZED XYLOPHONES THAT REQUIRE SEVERAL MEN TO PLAY ONE. IN EAST AFRICA, IN THE COUNTRY OF MOZAMBIQUE, AND TO BE MORE SPECIFIC, THE CHOPI PEOPLE HAVE CONCENTRATED ON THE XYLOPHONE. THEY ARE FAMOUS FOR THEIR KXREE ORCHESTRAS Ã¢Â€Â” FROM AS LOW AS FIVE PLAYERS UP 30 GROUPS WITH THIRTY OR MORE. LET'S PLAY THIS FIRST RECORDING OF A CHOPI ORCHESTRA OF 19 XLOPHONES.THE MUSIC IS JUST AN EXCERPT FROM AN ORCHESTRAL SUITE THATUSUALLY LASTS ABOUT #5 MINUTES! CUT ONE: #300 XYLOPHONE MUSIC OF THE CHOPI IN MOZAMBIQUE. YOU SAID, LEO THAT THERE WERE NINETEEN XYLOPHONES IN THAT GROUP. THERE MUST BE DIFFERENT TYPE S BECAUSE I COULD HEAR A NUMBER OF GREATLY VARYING TONESI I SHOULD HAVE MENTIONED BEFORE THAT THE XYLOPHONE IN MOZAMBIQUE IS CALLED TIMBILA AND THAT THERE ARE ACTUALLY FIVE TYPES - THE TREBLE, THE ALTO, TENOR, BASS AND DOUBLE-BASS. THEXTXMBKX HISTORICAL RECORDS SHOW THAT THE REE CRAFT OF MAKING TIMBILA XYEOPHONES AND THE ART OF GROUP PLAYING HAD ALREADY-BEEN WELL ESTABLSSHED BY THE CHOPI AS FAR BACK AS THE EARLY SIXTEENTH CENTURY. ALL THE MATERIALS USED IN THE MAKING OF THE INSTRUMENTS, SUCH AS THE VARIOUS WOODS, THE BEESWAX, THE PALM-LEAF STRINGS AND THE RESONATORS ARE USUALLY COLLECTED Ã‚Â» .va.:rÃ‚Â¢.>n(-:zÃ‚Â» mm.Ã‚Â» Ã‚Â» ,6Ã¢Â€Âœ: (H {3 ""C?

JUNE 18, 1978 MUSIC TIME IN AFRICA EAGE THREE WITHIN JUST A FEW MILES OF THE MAKERS VILLAGE. EXCEPT FOR A FEW SIMPLE Ga CARPENTER'S TOOLS, EVERYTHING THAT GOES INTO THE CONSTRUCTION OF THE TIMBILA ea COMES FROM RIGHT CLOSE BY, AND ALL THE RAW MATERIALS ARE PROCESSED AND PUT . . _ rÃ¢Â€Â˜ RITA: LEO: RITA : LEO: TOGETHER BY THE VILLAGE CRAFTEMEN. . m IT'S AMAZING, LEO, HOW THE INSTRUMENT MAKERS KNOW EXACTLY HOW TO SELECT THE RIGHT KIND OF WOOD. THE QUESTION IS HOW DID THEY COME BY THIS KNOWLEDGE OF THE 5Ã¢Â€Â˜ MUSIcAL PROPERTIES OF CERTAIN KINDS OF WOOD, WAS IT BY SHEER ACCIDENT, OR BY {3 OBSERVATIONÃ¢Â€Â™AND PRACTICAL EXPERIENCE? 5% WELL I GUESS THAT THE ONLY CONCLUSION WE CAN COME TO IS THAT THE CRAFTSMANSHIP . . A CR 0F AFRICAN INSTRUMENTÃ¢Â€Â”MAKERS MUST HAVE BEEN PERFECTED OVER MANY, MANY CENTURIES. 'AND THAT EACH GENERATION HAS HANDED DOWN ITS SECRETS BY PERSONAL INSTRUCTION. {a YOU'RE RIGHT WHEN YOU SAY AMZAING, BECAUSE WHEN A CHOPI MDSICIAN PICKS A CERTAIN HARDWOOD FOR THE NOTES OF HIS XYLOPHONE, IT SEEMS NOT ONLY To BE THE REST *i BEST IHXIHNEEIIEEXAREI, BUT THE ONLY REVEREERATING WOOD ON ANY QUALITY IN THE {5 WHOLE AREA. THE INSTRUMENTÃ¢Â€Â”MAKERS HAVE ALSO DISCOVERED SUCH THINGS THAT THE W '1 'FEMALE SPECIES OF A PARTICULAR TREE IS MORE RESONANT THAN THE MALE. AND THAT THE ' MOST MUSICALLY EFFECTIVE PART OF ANOTHER TREE IS THE ROOT. IT IS AMEXINGI gÃ¯Â¬Â WELL, WE'RE READY FOR MORE TIMBILA MUSIC. WHAT IS THE NEXT RECORDING YOU HAVE $3 HERE? I 7 Ã¢Â€Â˜ E3 THIS IS A FINE EXAMPLE OF AN ORCHEsTRAL INTRODUCTION BY A MASTER CRAFTSMAN AND $3 COMPOSER - KOMUKOMO. I HAVE NO IDEA WHETHER THIS FAMOUS HDSICIAN STILL LIVES 6; OR NOT, BECAUSE IT WAS IN THE VERY EARLY FIFTIES WHEN THIS RECORDING WAS MADE BY .Ã¯Â¬Â A g? AN EQUALLY FAMOUS MAN. MUSICOLOGIST HUGH TRACEY. IN THE RECORDING, WHICH IS

THIEXEXEIMPEEEEMXEEEX NEEMPHREXEEMXMEKNEEMEMXEE LEO, YOU SAID THAT THE PIECE OF MUSIC WE JUST LISTENED T0 WES THE FIRST PART OF A DANCE SUITE, CAN YOU EXPLAIN THAT A LITTLE MORE? IN THE FIRST PLACE, CHOPI XYDOPHONEE MUSIC IS ONE OF THE MOST ELABORATE TYPES OF AFRICAN MUSIC ON THE WHOLE CONTINENT. ACTUAL ORCHESTRAL SUITES ARE COMPOSED, COMPLETE AND DETAILED - AND NOT ONE NOTE OF THE MUSIC WRITTEN DOWN. CHOPI ORCHESTRAL DANCES ARE COMPLETE DANCE SHOWS, THE AND THE.ENTIRE PIECE IS KNOWN AS NGODO AND CONSLSB OF FROM NINE TO ELEVEN SEPARATE MOVEMENTS. USUALLY A WHOLE PERFORMANCE LASTS ABOUT FORTYÃ¢Â€Â”FIVES MINUTES OR MORE. SP YOU SEE, THERE'S NOTHING TRIVIAL ABOUT THIS ACCOMPLISHMENT. EVEN MORE REMARKARLE, IS THE FACT THAT NEW ORCHESTRAL DANCE SUITES ARE COMPOSED EVERY TWO YEARS OR SO. ,AS IN EVERY FORM OF ART -- MUSIC OR ANYTHING ELSE -- THE SAME DEGREE OF BRINLLIANCE ISN'T ACHIEVED BY EVERYONE, NOR IS IT EASILY COME BY. I'VE LEARNED LEO, THAT THE CHOPI SAY: ""TO PLAY THE TIMBILA, YOU MUST DREAM ABOUTJTÃ¢Â€Â™:Ã¢Â€Â™/ AND, NOT ONLY MUST YOU PRACTICE FAITHFULLY BUT YOU MUST START YOUNG.. THE CHOPI ALSO SAY THAT NO PLAYER WHO TOOK UP THE XYLOPHONE LATER TERI THAN HIS TEENS EVER BECAME A REALLY GOOD PLAYER.

r MUSIC: RITA: LEO: MUSIC: CUT FOUR! MUSIC TIME IN AFRICA JUNE 18, 1978 PAGE FIVE BEFORE WE LISTEN TO SOME EXAMPLEÃ‚Â§OF XYLOPHONES OF WEST AFRICA. THE FIRST TWO RECORDINGS OF CHOPI MUSIC WAS BY XYLOPHONES ONLY, BUT IN THIS ONE THERE ARE THREE DRUMS AND RATTLES ACCOMPANYING THE XYLOPHONES. THE MUSIC IS CALLED CHISOPI Ã¢Â€Â” MEANING A WILD AND ENERGETIC DANCE. IT'S PERFORMED BY TEE YBUNGER .PEOPLE OF BOTH SEXES, 0N HAPPY OCCASIONS Ã¢Â€Â” ESPECIALLY FOR INFORMAL MERRYMAKING IN THE EVENINGS: CUIÃ¢Â€Â˜ THREE: 3:15 MUSIC FOR THE CHISOPI DANCE OF THE CHOPI PEOPLE IN MOZAMBIQUE. I REALLY LIKE THAT, LEO. IT CERTAINLY DOES MAKE YOU WANT TO GET UP AND'PAHTICIPATE IN THE DANCING. I'M ANXIOUS NOW TO HEAR THE RECORDINGS OF XYLOPHONE MUSIC FROM WEST AFRICA. THIS FIRST EXAMPLE OF WEST AFRICAN XYLOPHONES IS A RECORDING I MADE DURING MY TRAVELS THROUGH UPPER VOLTA. I ATTENDED A HARVEST FESTIVAL IN THE BOBO DJIALASSO REGION WHERE A LARGE NUMBER OF MUSICAL GROUPS FROM MANY REGIONS HAD COME TO TAKE PART IN THE FESTIVITIES, MMEHXMTMXHXESMXMSMIME ONE OF THE GROUPS THAT ATTRACTED A LOT OF ATTENTION THAT DAY WAS THIS ONE REPRESENTING THE SIAMOU PEOPLE. THE XYKOPHONE WAS A FAIRLY LARGE ONE WITH TWENTY NOTES AND LARGE CALABASH RESONATORS, ME! AND REQUIRED TWO MEN TO PLAY IT. THE XYLOPHONES IN WEST AFRICA; ARE CALLED BALAFON. I'D LIKE TO MENTION THAT I WAS TOLD BY THE PEOPLE THERE THAT THE LEADER OF THE SMALL ORCHESTRA WAS CONSIDERED TO BE ONE OF. THE FINEST BALAFON PLAYERS IN THE COUNTRY: #:30 Mm, '1 {N

THAT WAS N'T RECORDED DURING THE XEDI HARVEST CELEBRATION, WAS IT? I RECORDED THE GROUP A COUPLE OF DAYS LATER IN THEIR . , THE VILLAGE. THE COMBINATION OF INSTRUMENTS ~ THAT IS, THE TONES OF/WOODEN FLUTE LEOT ACTUALLY IT WASN'T RITA. AND IRON GONGS COMBINED WITH THE RICH TONES OF THE XYLOPHONE - ALONG NITH THE RATHER HEAVY SLOW TEMPO OF THE MUSIC GAVE YOU THAT MISTERIOUS FEELING. BUT THIS XXIII NEXT NUMBER WILL PUT YOU INTO A HAPPIER MOOD. IT'S MUSIC BY A POPULAR DANCE BAND IN DOUALA, CAMEROON, ENE AND DEMONSTRATES THE USE OF TRADITIONAL MUSICAL INsTRUMENTS.

The AGIDIGBO is usually a rectangular wooden sound box with several metal strips attached to the face of the instrument. It's played by striking the metal notes with the fingers and Kili' often used along wdth other instruments. In this example of WORO music, the song begins with the rhythm played on the the pressureetype talking drum called the GANGAN (gahn-gahn), followed by the pulsating beats of the AGIDIGBO and metal gongs: CDT FOUR: 5:15 To wind up today's program of music from Nigeria, here's a recording from the mid-western stats region.

I'm sure. you'll enjoy the music so join me now for Music Iime in Africa: MUSIC: THEME: 10 SECS, ULDER AND OUT: Music of the Bisa is mainly noted for its vitality and an original vocal style. Bisa vocal art makes use of vibrato or tremelo, as well as other effects where the male voice, or the female voice, improvises in solo with great mobility. Characteristic of Bisa singing is the precise ornamental musical phrasing. A very good example of this vocal technique is this recording gggein the town of / TENKODOGO in which GANSSA WANDAOGO sings the praises of various families of Bisa farmers: CUT ONE: 2328 Some of the principal musical instruments used by Bisa musicians are the KONE ÃƒÂ©konÃ¢Â€Â”eh), an mbira or sanza type handÃ¢Â€Â”piano, the doudouga, a one-string fiddle, the KONDE(konÃ¢Â€Â”deh), a two-strSng lute, the DIENGUELA musical bow with calabash resonator, a transverse flute called LONÃ¢Â€Â”TOREH, the HIRRI, which is a globe- shaped whistle, the BOUMPA, a type of horn and of course a number of different

First in the orchestra is the ENEEEKK ENDOUM, with two keys: next to it is the NIENG which has six keys. The other three // instruments have nine keys each but carry different names also - OMVAC, AKOUROU and OLOLON. All of the xykophones have frames covered in fabric supporting the keys and all have calabash resonators. The musician plays standing up with the instrument held in place horizmntally by a strap resting on his back and a wooden hoop fixed to the frame of the instrument, resting against his thighs. A whistle gives signals for the group to start and for the end of the piece:

The MVET is made from a palm-tree stem, in the middle of which is a vertical bridge of bamboo with several notches holding a number of strings lifted out of the bark, thus forming a double triangle. The tension of each string is regulated by means of a ring which slides along the stem. Three calabash resonators are fixed at equal distances along the stem - one in the middle. and one KÃ¯Â¬ÂÃ¯Â¬Âh at each end. The musician presses the middle calabash resonator against his chest or stomach when he plays and plucks the steings with the fingers of both hands. The instrument is used by musicians to narrate their long epic~poems nhich are very well known in the FANG country. The MVET performances usually take place in the evening and often last all night. The spectators take part by singing certain passages of the text in chorus: CUT FIVE: 5'3Ã¢Â€Â˜2 C) The NGOMBI eightÃ¢Â€Â”string harp of the FANG plays a major role in the music for the BWITI cult.

MUSIC: THEME: 10 SECS, UNDER AND OUT: VOICE: Our music today comes from one of the old known countries in the world, Ethiopia. Ethiopia's long and uninterrupted history dates back to about 1000 BC and still retains its rich cultural ElsibÃ¯Â¬Âi traditions - especially in the music and dances of the many ethnic groups in the country. The earliest traditions of / religious dances go back to Old Testament times. During church services or at inIIKXMXÃ¯Â¬ÂKMIgIMhHXHKÃ¯Â¬Â‚i religious festivals, specially trained priests perform sacred dances to the accompaniment of the drum and sistra.

A delightful old world instrument, it Traditional musical instruments are still being used in their original form. The BEGANA, the Ethiopian lyre. is the most important and resembles the lyre of the Greeeks and the Romans and is believed to be exactly like the legendary harp of David. It has eight to twelve strings that are plucked with the fingers. The body is usually shaped like a section cut out of a pyramid or occasionally it may be bowl-shaped, covered with skin or parchment stretched over its open front. Two other important stringed instruments used by Ethiopian musicians are the MASENKO and the MRAR. The MASENKO, a violin~type of instrument is the only bowed musical instrument in EZEEEXK Ethiopia. It has a diamondshaped wooden body covered with skin or parchment and a single string made of several

IQ""TIME IN AFKECA JUNE 1977 Page two strands of horsehair. The bow is arc-shaped and strung with thickly stranded horsehair. The player of the MASENKO is found everywhere - there is hardly a village where he is not to be seen, and his usual role is to accompany a song in solo or chorus. The other important instrument is the KRAR - a six-stringed KKK; lyre also plucked with the fingers or a plectrum. The body is like a shallow bowl hollowed out of wood/or merely a tin box. 0n the front it is covered with skin stretched by a wire and a second piece of skin covers the underside and also stretched with a piece of wire. Out of the box or body. two arms of the instrument protude at an angle away from each other. A cross-bar at the top joins the two arms, forming a triangle. The strings are attached to the erode-bar and stretched over a bridge on the skin of the bowl.lfboth the MASENKO and the KRAR. as well as the BEGANA are accompanied by flutes and drums in this selection based on old folk tunes played during wedding ceremonies. The song. titled ""My wedding day!"" describes the brides feelings as she leaves her parent's home to start a new life with her husband: ' SIC cur ONE: M07 ICE: The same group of musicians play and sing this next folksong from the MENZ region of SHEWA province in Ethiopia.

The WASHINT is a simple In ,-~t flute made from a length of bamboo cane. It has, usually, four KHIKK finger- . ,~ holes. The top of the instrument is cut open as a mouthpiece, forming a right {\ angle with 1K1 a thin lower edge. This sets the air column in the flute ,~ vibrating. It is entirely secular in use, generally accompanying other musical instruments, percussion or stringed, in a choral or solo song or a dance.

It has no finger-holes. The mouthpiece is U-shaped and V formed by the removal of a slice of bamboo for about one-third the width of the bore of the pipe.

The music will be traditional songs performed by the leading professional musicians of the country. So once again, friends. join me for Music Time: in Africa: MUSIC: THEME: 10 SECS, UNDER AND OUT: // VOICE: The exotic music of Mauretania is based on an extremely intricate and complex musical theory - especially the techniques of playing the indigenous musical instruments. Musicians in Mauretania are professionals who form their own special category in the Moorish society and are commonly known as GRIOTS (gree-oh's), just as the folk musicians throughout Vest Africa are called. This includes both both men and women. The techniques of their craft, especially the instrumental techniques, are handed down from generation to generation - orally of course. The two main instruments played by the Moorish griots are the Ardin and the Tidinit. The Ardin is a harpÃ¢Â€Â™played by the Moorish women griots. It usually has ten strings but this number varies frequently. Traditionally the Tidinit, a four-string lute, is reserved for the male musicians. Similar to the KONNI of Mali and Guinea, and the Halam of Senegal, the Tidinit of Mauretania is a long, narrow wooden sound box with a skin stretched over it. The neck of the instrument is simply a wooden stick, a pole fixed into the soundbox under the skin. The strings are stretched over a bridge and fixed at one end to the tip of its the neck and at the other end to leather rings round the neck proper. The strings are tuned by moving XEEXIKEIKKX the leather rings. IKEXIIEIXIIXKEÃ¯Â¬ÂIKÃ¯Â¬Â The Ã¢Â€Â”> Tidinit sounds like this: MLSIC: cur ONE: 0:157

As I mentioned 1311} before, the two main musical instruments in Mauretania are the TIDINIT and the ARDIN. the harp reserved for women. The neck of the ARDIN, which is more than three feet long. is fixed into the half shell of a large calabash used as a resonator. The resonator is covered with a taut skin and the strings run perpendicular to it. The strings are fixed to pegs placed at 3 various levels 1Ã¢Â€Â˜: U.SÃ¢Â€Â˜ GOVERNMENT PRENYINC OFFICE 19/6~596-99 and at regular intervals along the neck pole. The resonator, of course.

A mode in Moorish "" music is fairly close to the Western idea of a mode, though not exactly in the fÃ¢Â€Â same scope. It is often difficult to determine the actual mode in which a piece of music is being played. There are at least four principal modes within each of the three styles of music. The modes are known as KARR, VAGHD, SÃƒÂ©lNTMA and BÃƒÂ©ldI. Now here is where it begins to get a little more complex. The name of a mode changes - depending in which style it is played. For example, if the mode KARR is played in the black style, it's called ""N'TEMASS"", while in the white style the KARR mode would be called MEKKE-MUSA. And in the third style, ' the spotted style, the KARR mode would be called ""NOUÃƒÂ©FEL"". Actually. each mode or scale in Moorish music is characterized not only by its particular musical contents, but also by the circumstances. themes and moods xxx with which it is conventionally connected. What I mean by this is {Ã‚Â£21, for example. that the mode KARE is linked with the idea of gladness and joy, the mode VAGHO with the theme of war and courage, strength and pride, 1X1 the mode SEINIMA is associated with more complex black and white styles, and the BEIGI mode is connected with nostalgia, melancholy or lament. I think these thingsÃ¢Â€Â™;hat I've 3311 said about Moorish music shows the rxnxxxxxx cultural richness which exists in African traditional music. A we11~known virtuoso on the TIDINIT and fammus Moorish singer is SIDI AHMED EL BAKAY (buck-eye) OULD ANA and in this recording he performs in the sÃƒÂ©INI KARE mode in the black style: CUTWSGGÃ¢Â€Â˜WI FIVE: 2315 That was music in the black style and played in the SEINI KARR mode. Now here is an excerpt from a concert of MboriSh music which begins, as is the custom, with a sort of instrumental introduction, during which the griot adjusts the tuning of the instrument, getting into the mood of the chosen mode. IKHXKKIKEKIIEXÃ¢Â€Â˜ The musician in this EXXB performance is a celebrated griot from the town of MEDERDRA and he plays and sings in the VAGHO mode - which I explained as the

It's very rare that a griot would improvise as he sings along. Actually, these musicians can develop a whole song from just a few verses, prolong a syllable or even confine himself 1 to the repitition of a very hrief phrase.

The playing of flutes and whistles in groups IKXXKEIEK in Africa dates back through the centuries, and is common in a number of countries on the continent. In southern Africa, the TSWANA, SOTHO and VENDA are known for their reed flute ensembles, which provide the entertainment at festivities, compete in friendly fashion or get together simply for the sheer enjoyment. Reed flutes, or their metal substitutes. vary in length and are tuned to the principal flute of the group. The tuning is done during the making of the instrument. Each player sounds his flute once in EKhZXIIIHÃ¯Â¬ÂXXXEpIIXEKK repititious phrases using 3 to five notes.

The tuning varies from performance to performance and the pitch of the instrument can be varied by the player both by the position of the lips and tongue over the mouthpiece and by the force of wind, especially noticeable in the higher-pitched pipes.

To prevent the cracking of the wooden pipes, they are often encased in the skin of a wild pig's tail shrunk onto the hollowed pipe while still wet. This recording starts with the sound of the MAMBUTI pygmy hunting pipes with which they call to each other in the forest while hunting. Instaniiy at the sound of these pipes the pygmy hunters lift up their heads and begin yodelling or singing other notes far more powerful than one would expect from so small people. The hunting call in this rrcotding is followed by a dance tune by an ensemble of 10 pipes, accompanied by two laced drums and rattles: 3:10 TR-125 A-8,9,2,1 VOICE: An ensemble of ten end-blown pipes played by the MAMBUTI pymies of Zaire.

It was one of the most densely populated of the former French colonies. The approximately 2% million people can be divided into three major tribal groups - the FON in the south, the ADJA along the Mono and Couffe rivers. and the Bariba in the north Ã¢Â€Â” all of which have their own sub-groups - each with E1 its own language, music and dances, and musical instruments. BENIN, as you know, was formerly called DAHOMEY and there are many written historical accounts, in great detail about the ancient Dahomean kingdoms. Probably the most qouted siurce of information is a book called ""A history of Dahomey"" , written and published in the 18th century. One of the reasons for so many written accounts of life in this part of the African continent ii is that the coast of DAHOMEY was of major importance at that time. It was the chief center for the slave trade of the 17th and 18th centuries. and during the 18th century, a large number of kingdoms existed. As the slave trade developed along the coast ,a rivalries among the Kings increased - all resulting in political disorder for many years. The long-lived Kings of Dahomey ruled up through the 19th Century.

I noted in a previous program that musicologists conifer the long history of existence of the bowl lyre in East :1Ã¢Â€Â™rica and especially in the Lake Victoria region. This lovely instrument, which has many different names, according to the various language grouos, is called the KIPUKANDET by the NANDI Although I've described the bowl lyre in detail on previous programs, I'll just mention that it begins with a framework built on a wooden bowl. Tn, framework is two wooden arms in the shape of a ""V"" and attached to the face of the bowl which provides the resonance. The strings are strung from a parallel crossbar that connects the two arms. Eben the instrument 0 is strumzed lik. a miter it produces a characteristic Ã¢Â€ÂœbuzzingÃ¢Â€Â or ""rattling"" Q ( sound as the strings vibrate against a piece of flattened cane acting as a bridge.

It is said that in the old days, the dance was used before going! out on a KÃ¯Â¬Â‚Ã¯Â¬Â‚ raiding party. It was originally sang and performed by the raiding party in A sitting position. Later it was used solely as a dance and performed by young men at night as general entertainment. A group of young NANDI men sing the song for the CEEEytELIT dance in this next recording, followed by another tune by a group of men from the Lake BARINGO region: CUTÃ¢Â€Â˜THRSE: Continuing our pregram of folk music of the NAUDI people in KENYA, IXK Td-164 A-i, 9 and 10 5315 I've selected some fine examples of the songs accompanying one of the most spectacular danoe performances in East Africa Ã¢Â€Â” the MORAN dance, in which young men link arms in a circle and step sideways to the rhythm of the song while others enter the ring and leap like a coiled spring straight up into the air.

I'm sure you'll enjoy the recordings so stay with me now for Music Time kn African THEME:10 SECS, UNDER AND OUT: In recent years, historians have decided that one of the most important peoples of Central Africa, from a historical pint point of View, is the LUBA of the KATANGA and KASAI regions in the southeastern part of Zaire. Both archeological and linguistic evidence point to LUBA country as a region with an old established civilization. Ihe result of excavations along the empire of considerable wealth and dimensions. Much of the information about migrations and invasions by various peoples during the 15th and 16th centuries in the regions of ANGOLA and ZAIRE are based on traditional oral history, but written lÃ¯Â¬ÂlÃ¯Â¬Â‚Ã¯Â¬ÂlÃ¯Â¬Âl documentary information, describing in detail about LUBA traditic / appeared about the middle of the 16th century./One of the earlie states in Central Africa to be remembered was that of the

IÃ¢Â€Âœ V (a s , Music TIME IN AFRICA MUSIC: VOICE: page 2 KALUNDWE on the LUBILASH river. This state was infiltrated and then conquered by a people from the north called the SONGYE The SONGYE KIRK established a powerful empire in KATANGA that spread over a wide area and probably survived for several centuries. The decline and overthrow of the SONGYE empire caused much turbulence and long-distance migrations which finally resulted in the establishndnt of the LUBA empire. According to new documentary evidence, this took place sometime between the lhth and 15th centuries. I mentioned earlier that much of what we know about the LUBA has been based on oral IKXHXIXKKI history and, as you know, traditional music plays an important role in oral history. As memories of the older historians are orally passed down from generation to generation, so ta3:;Ã‚Â°the legends,xnn the genealogic and lineage histories and other statements of origin and geographical data transmitted in the verses of IHKXXKIX songs by folk musicians and itinerant troubadors. In this first recording a Luba music, we hear a large choral group performing a composition x called ""Memories of a hunter"".

Actually the word BUGANDA means the same as UGANDA which is a KISWAHILI word meaning the country of the GANDA people.

Music, musical instruments, and self-adornment were the most notable forms of traditional artistic expression. ihe GANDA were always considered to be the best drum carvers and the most important and elaborate drums were the royal drums, executed by skilled artisans. The royal drums played an important EÃ¯Â¬Âlh part in the rituals of the royal courts in the past. Limited in number and verr ornate the- were made of hollowed-out tree trunks encased 3 .9 Ã¢Â€Â™ \

I HAVE BEEN, -- AND I'D LIKE TO PDINT OUT SOME OF THE SIGNIFICANT 1} CHANGES WHICH I THINK HAVE TAKEN PLACE. I THINK NIGERIA IS A 'PRIME EXAMPLE. THAT COUNTRY HAS BEEN AFFECTED BY THE IMPACT OF EUROPEAN CULTURE AND ALTHOUGH ATTITUDES TOWARD WESTERN MUSIC HAVE BEEN SOMEWHAT MIXED, IT IS QUITE EVIDENT THAT CERTAIN ELEMENTS I HAVE BEEN INCORPORATED IN NIGERIAN MUSIC AS A RESULT OF THE WESTERN IMPACT. IN VIEW OF ALL THIS, ONE MIGHT CONCLUDE THAT THE Ã¢Â€Â˜ QUESTION WE SHOULD BE ASKING NOW, IS NOT WHETHER NIGERIAN MUSIC HAS BEEN CHANGING BUT HOW MUCH AND IN WHAT REPECTS IT HAS CHANGED. ÃƒÂ©HTTÃ¯Â¬ÂE: WELL, I THINK THE QUESTION THAT MOST PEOPLE MIGHT ASK IS WHETHER % ELEO: ifÃ¢Â€Â™MÃ¢Â€Â˜. MN AmpLM-mÃ¯Â¬Â‚Ã¯Â¬Âm-w: v . z...Ã‚Â» ;VOICR: <. v. ,Ã¢Â€Â˜ \r. IRLEO % g THESE CHANGES YOU XIX ARE TALKING ABOUT ARE A GOOD THING OR NOT{ THATÃ¢Â€Â˜S TRUE. SPEAKING PERSONALLY, I WELCOME THE CHANGES. IÃ¢Â€Â˜M STRENGLY IN FAVOR OF THE WAY AFRICAN MUSICAL TRADITIONS ARE CHANGINC TO SUIT CONTEMPORARY SOCIETY. I LOOK AT AFRICA, WHICH HAS SUCH A GREAT VARIETY OF FORMS OF MUSIC ONE OF THE WORLD'S MOST EXCITING MUSICAL AREAS. THE MOST STRIRIRO FESTURE OF TRS VARIETY IS THE PRESENCE OF THEOLD AND THENEW, AND THE MOST ENCOURAGING FEATURE IS, PERHAPS, THE FACT THAT IN WEST AFRICA, AT LEAST, TRADITIONAL STYLES ROT ONLY RLOURISR, BUT REMAIN THE PRINCIPAL IRSTRRST OF MOST AFRICANS, A WONDERFUL COMPLEX ' SIRTRRMXRRSIRRSIURUTSRRXRXTSRTTS. MUSICAL CULTURE EXISTS IN WHICH ' ' NRw FORMS ARE SIMPLY ADDED To THE OLD FORMS OF MUSIC. WHAT WOULD YOU SAY ARE THE MAIN TYPES OF MUSIC BEING PRACTICED IN AFRICA TODAY. ' 2 :~ I'D BEGIN wITR TRADITIONAL MUSIC, WHICH IS YOU ALREADI KNOW, HAS Ã¢Â€Â˜BEEN MY PROME INTEREST. THEN THERE IS WHAT RR CALL NEO-TRADITIONAL MUSIC. THEOTHER TYPES ARE WESTERNIZED POP MUSIC, WESTERN POP MUSIC, AND LEO, I ALSO KNOW THAT YOU'VE BEEN INTERESTED AND CONCERNED WITH 53 rm- m S... D M.

EEO-TRADITIONAL MUSIC USES NEW MUSICAL FORMS WHICH COME OUT OF TRADITIONAL MUSIC BUT NOT NECESSARELY IN THE SAME CONTEXT OR SETTING AS THEY ARE FOUND IN THE TRADITIONAL CULTURE. I GUESS THE BEST EXAMPLE OF EEO-TRADITIONAL MUSIC IN NIGERIA ARE THE SOÃ¢Â€Â”CALLED FOLK OF THE YORUBA IN EIICH TRADITIONAL MUSIC IS PRESENTED OUTSIDE THE SETTING OF SOCIAL CEREMONIES. HERE, LET ME PLAY THIS RECORDING TO ILLUSTRATE WHAT I MEAN. I RECORDED THIS IN THE TOWN OF OSHOGBO NIGERIA ITÃ¢Â€Â™S PART OF THE LATE DURO LADIPO'S YORUBA OPERA ""EDA"": "" CUT ONE: h:20 I LIKE THAT MUSIC VERY MUCH. I THINK IT'S EXCITING. NOT TO CHANGE THE SUBJECT, I REMEMBER THE MUSIC TIME IN AFRICA SHOW THAT FEATURED DURO LADIPO'S MUSIC, I GUESS THAT WAS ABOUT THREE YEARS AGO. WE'LL HAVE To DO THAT'SHOW AGAIN SOON. NOW BACK TO THAT WE WERE TALKING ABOUT, EHOW DO YOU DESCRIBE THE WESTERNIZED POP MUSIC :*AÃ¯Â¬Â‚w#v YOU MENTIONED AS ONE OF THE TYPES OF MUSIC IN AFRICA TODAY? WESTERNIEED POP MUSIC HAS MANY TRADITIONAL ELEMENTS BUT IT ALSO ICONTAINS SOME ELEMENTS OF WESTERN MUSIC AND SERVES THE SAME PURPOSE IN AFRICA AS W STERN POP MUSIC DOES IN THE NESTERN WORLD; I BROUGHT ITÃ¢Â€Â˜S A MUSIC IN THIS RECORDING OE NEAT IS KNOWN AS JUJU MUSIC. WHICH YORUBA MUSICAL INSTRUMENTS ARE COMBINED WITH THE WESTERN GUITAR OR ACCORDION. TEE MELODIC STYLE, I THINK; IS CLOSER T0 THAT OE WESTERN MUSIC THAN THAT OE YORUBA MUSIC. IT'S AN OLD RECORDING BY THE YOUNG BABY FACE JUJU BAND: TSIC: CUT TWO: 3:00 A x '3 my OPERAS

COMPOSERS 0F AFRICAN CHURCH FUSIC HAVE INCREASINGLY USED TRADITIONAL ELEMENTS IN THEIR MUSIC AND SDME OF THE MOST EXCITING EXPERIMENTS IN NEG-TRADITIONAL MUSIC HAVE BEEN CARRIED OUT IN THE CHURCH. EXAMPLES ARE THE FAMOUS MISSA LUBA OF HYMNS ZAIRE THE GIRMA MASS OF UPPER VOLTA THE KENS OFLTHE WEST AFRICAN SEPARATIST CHURCHS AND THE PSALMS AND MASS IN THE EWONDO L IGUAGE 0F CAMEROON THIS RECORDING WAS MADE INiTHE CATHEDRAL OF YAOUNDE IN CAMEROON AND METAL GONGS ARE CUT THREE: 2:h6 AND I ALSO LIKE IN THE MUSIC, THE TRADITIONAL XYLOPHONES AND BEING USED: THAT VERY MUXCH LEO.

HOW ABOUT EXPLAINENG THAT FURTHER?V O.K. FIRST, THE WESTERN POP MUSIC.

IT CERTAINLY IS A BEAUTIFUL EDUND! THAT WAS A TIMBILA ORCHESTRA - A SPECIAL GROUP OF REALLY GREAT MUSICIANS, OF THE CHOPI PEOPLE IN MOZAMBIQUE I'D LIKE TO BEGIN TALKING ABOUT THIS MUSIC, RITA, BY FIRSIÃ¢Â€Â˜ EEPLAINING THAT XYLOPHONES ARE CALLED TIMBILA BY THE CHOPI, AND THAT THE CHBI HAVE BEEN FAMOUS FOR THEIR MUSIC FOR CENTURIES Ã¢Â€Â” FfDM ANCIENT TEES. THEY PLAY LARGE ORgESIRAsggv-OODEN XYLOPHONES AND THEIR ORCHESTRAL DANCES, CALLED ""NGODO"" AIRWNOST ADVANCED EXAMPLEiOF AFRICAN ARTISTIC ENDEAVOR IN THE SOUTHERN PART OF THE CONTIEEET. FOR TH] BENEFIT OF LISTENI'RS IN MOTHER PARTS OF AFRICA AND FORM OUR FANS IN OTHER PARTS OF THE OORLD, YOU CAN ADD SOME BACKGROUND RITA, BECAUSE I KNOW THAT YOU'VE DONE RESEARCH AND SOLE STUDIES ON THIS AREA: WELL, PRINCIPALLY, THE HOME COUNTRY OF THE CHOPI IS mm A SMALL TRIANGULAR PIECE OF LAME COUNTRY JUST EAST OF THE MOUTH OF THE LIMPOPO RIVER, IN THE DISTRICT OF ZAVALA IN MOZAMBIQUE AND, AS YOU'VE ALREADY SAID, LEO, THE CHOPI MUSICIANS HAVE BEEN KNOWN FOR THEIR LARGE TIMBILA ORCHESTRAS FOR MANY YEARS. IN THE PAST, ORCHESTRAS WERE TO BE FOUND IN EVERY LARGE VILLAGE AND ALL THE IMPORTANT CHIEFS HAD THEIRM OWN NGODO OF ORCHESTRA AND DANCERS. ""NGODO"", SOMETIMES PRONOUNCED IGODO, INGODO, OR MUGODO, MEANS ""THE WHOLE SHOW"", WHICH INCLUDES BOTH THE DANCERS AND THEPLAYEHS OF THE TIMBILA AND THEIR PERFORMANCE. As YOU KNOW, THE INSTRUMENTS AMDTHE SONGS AND DANCES REFLECT GREAT CREDIT UPON THE ABILITIES OF THE CHOPI. WHEN ONE REMEMBERS THAT NOT A NOTE OF THEIR MUSIC HAS EVER BEEN WRITTEN DOWN, NOR THE WORDS OF THEIR POETRY WRITTEN OR TRANSLATED, IT IS REMARKABLE, LEO, TO FIND THAT THEY COMPOSED NEW NGODO WITH ALMOST UNFAILING REGULARITY EVERY TWO YEARS OR SO. AND AGAIN, THE RET-DRKABLE THING ABOUT THIS IS THAT EACH MOVEMENT IS NEW DISTINCTIVE AND SEPARATE, AND MAY LAST FROM A MINUTE ONLY TB UP TO FIVE OR SIX MINUTES EACH. THE WHOLE PERFORMANCE TAKES AS- A RULE ABOUT FORTY-FIVE MINUTES, DEPENDING ON THE ROUTINE OF THE HANGERS AND THE

ALRIGHT, BUT TOW, WHAT IS THE FIRST THING THET A CONPUSER ERRED ACTUALLY W HE SETS ABOUT FINDING APPROPRIATE WORDS FOR HIS SONGS AND BEGINS OOHPOSING I A/V FW/YV VERSES OF THE LYRIC Ã¢Â€Â” ALL THIS IS DONE BEFORE W THE: MUSIC. IN EVERY CASE, THE SUBJECT MATTER OF THE POETRY, WHETHER IT BE GAY, SAD OR DOCUMENTARY, NOULD BE HIGHLY TOPICAL AND APPRORIATE TO THE IDCALITY. WHAT DO YOU MEAN BY Ã¢Â€Â” HIGHLY TOPICAL, APPROPRIATE? WELL, YOU WOULD HAVE TO BE REALLY IN TOUCH WITH VILLAGERS AND THE DISTRICT IN ORDER TO BE ABLE TO UNDERSTAND THE MEANING OF THE UDRDS OF THE SONGS. SONG POEMS WERE OFTEN HIGHLY CRITICAL OF THOSE IN AUTHORITY AND TO A DEGREE, IT MAY BE SAID THAT THE POEMS REFLECTED THE ATTITUDE OF THE COMMON PEOPLE TOWHRDS THE CONDITIONS OF THEIR SOCIETY. GOOD HUMOR WAS ALWAYS A FEATURE IN THE SONGS, AS WELL AS SLY DIGS AT PEOPLE WHO NEGLECTED THEIR DUTIES IN THE COMMUNITY AND PROTESTS AGAINST SOCIAL INJUSTICES - ALL THESE WERE IN THE SONGS OF THE COMPOSERS. THIS IS WHERE AFRICAN MUSIC PERFORMED A HIGHLY IMPORTANT SOCIAL FUNCTION - BECAUSE IN THE OLD DAYS, IN THE PAST, THERE WAS N3 DAILY PRESS, PUBLICATIONS, RADIO OR TELEVISION,_ SO THE ONLY STAGE TO PUBLICLY EXPRESS FEELINGS AND PROTESTS WAS THE VILLAGE COURTYIRRD. v

RITA: LED MUSIC: MUSIC: LEO: MUSIC: VOICE: TIME IN AFRICA JANUARY 20, 1980 PAGE POUR OKAY, AFTER THE COMPOSER HAS THE VERSES FOR HIS SONGS, HHAT NEXT? THE COMPOSPR THEN MUST FIND THE MELODY. HE SITS AT HIS INSTRm-CENIÃ¢Â€Â˜, THE TIMBILA RIGHT HAND, HOLDING A RUBBER-HEADED STICK, XYLOPHONE, AND HIS EDDIE EXPERTEDLY WANDEIB OVER THE KEYS PICKING OUT A NEW MEIDDY. AFTER A WHILE, WHEN HIS RIGHT HAND BECOMES ACCUSTOMED TO THE NEW TUNE, HIS LEFT HAND BEGINS TO FILL IN THE HARMONIES, OR CONTRAÃ¢Â€Â”MEIODY. As HE SINGS THE VDRDS OVER TO HIMSELF THE MUSICAL ACCOMPANIMENT BEGINS To TAKE FORM UNDER HIS HANDS. NOW, THE HONDERPUL PART OF THIS IS THEN THAT AS THE COMPOSER DEVELOPS THE MAIN MUSICAL THEME, THE OTHER MUSICIANS IN THE ORCHESTRA BEGIN IMPROVISING THEIRE OWN PARTS ON THE VARIOUS PITCHED TIMBILAS ALL THE PLAYERS CONFORM To C) THE PATTERN SET BY THE COMPOSER WHO PUTS THE FINAL TOUCH BY COMPOSING AN,IKIRGEHK1 rx INTRODUCTION.
